Agent-Based Modelling of Future Dairy and Plant-Based Milk Consumption for UK Climate Targets,"Matthew Gibson, Joana Portugal Pereira, Raphael Slade and Joeri Rogelj","Plant-Based Milk, Dairy Reduction, Sustainable Diets, Agent-Based Modelling, Calibration, Scenario Analysis","A reduction in the production and consumption of meat and dairy across much of the world is critical for climate change mitigation, the alleviation of ecological stress, and improved health. We update an agent-based model (ABM) of historic UK milk consumption and apply it to scenarios of dairy reduction and adoption of plant-based milk (PBM) out to 2050. The updated model is comprised of a cognitive function, where agents perceive the physical, health and environmental characteristics of milk choice, which is modified by habit and social influence. We use European Social Survey 2018 and British Social Attitudes 2008 survey data to empirically inform the model. Taking a backcasting approach, we calibrate parameters against published UK dairy reduction targets (2030 and 2050), and test how different price relationships, and characterisations of environmental concern, may affect simulated milk consumption from 2020 to 2050. Scenarios for core targets (20% less dairy by 2030 and 35% by 2050) largely produced plausible consumption trajectories. However, at current pricing of dairy and PBM, simulated consumption was mostly unable to deliver on desired core targets, but this improved markedly with dairy prices set to organic levels. The influence of changing environmental concern on milk choice resulted in higher levels of dairy milk reduction. When modelled as transient, intense shocks to public concern, consumption patterns did not fundamentally change. However, small, incremental but permanent changes to concern did produce structural changes to consumption patterns, with dairy falling below plant-based alternatives at around 2030. This study is the first to apply an ABM  in the context of scenarios for dairy reduction and PBM adoption in service to UK climate-related consumption targets. It can serve as valuable bottom-up, alternative, evidence on the feasibility of dietary shift targets, and poses policy implications for how to address impediments to behavioural change."
ReMoTe-S. Residential Mobility of Tenants in Switzerland: An Agent-Based Model,"Anna Pagani, Francesco Ballestrazzi, Emanuele Massaro and Claudia R. Binder","Household Mobility, Household Relocation, Housing, Human-Environment Systems, Sustainability, Agent-Based Modelling","Sustainable housing is a key priority for Switzerland. To provide both environmentally and socio-culturally sustainable housing, Swiss property owners need to navigate the complex and context-specific system that articulates the match between households’ preferences and the dwellings available to them—i.e., residential mobility. In response to this need, this paper outlines ReMoTe-S, an agent-based model of tenants’ residential mobility in Switzerland. The model design is based on empirical research conducted with the tenants of three multifamily housing providers. It accounts for the life course of dwellings and households, during which the latter attempt to maximise their satisfaction, which is calculated as the correspondence between their desired housing functions (e.g. a status symbol) and the functions of dwellings. To illustrate the model’s potential uses, we explore the sensitivity of its outputs to changes in dwellings’ and buildings’ qualitative and quantitative features by looking at two key indicators of housing sustainability: floor space per capita and vacancy rate. We firstly observe that a supply dominated by medium-to-large dwellings and the application of less strict occupancy rules can result in housing underoccupancy. Secondly, it emerges that certain combinations of housing features engender a lower vacancy rate inasmuch as they more successfully generate housing functions. We conclude that by enabling housing providers to explore the complex human-environment interactions of the housing system, ReMoTe-S can be used to inform a sustainable management of housing stock."
Sharing Risk Under Heterogeneity: Exploring Participation Patterns in Situations of Incomplete Information,Eva Vriens and Vincent Buskens,"Risk-Sharing, Risk Aversion, Solidarity, Uncertainty, e, Adverse Selection","Motivated by the emergence of new Peer-to-Peer insurance organizations that rethink how insurance is organized, we have proposed a theoretical model of decision-making in risk-sharing arrangements with risk heterogeneity and incomplete information about the risk distribution as core features. For these new, informal organizations, the available institutional solutions to heterogeneity (e.g., mandatory participation or price differentiation) are either impossible or undesirable. Hence, we need to understand the scope conditions under which individuals are motivated to participate in a bottom-up risk-sharing setting. The model considers participation as a utility-maximizing alternative for agents with higher risk levels, agents who are more risk averse, are driven more by solidarity motives, and less susceptible to cost fluctuations. This basic micro-level model is used to simulate decision-making for agent populations in a dynamic, interdependent setting. Simulation results show that successful risk-sharing arrangements may work if participants are driven by motivations of solidarity or risk aversion, but this is less likely in populations more heterogeneous in risk, as individual motivations can less frequently make up for larger cost deficiencies. At the same time, more heterogeneous groups deal better with uncertainty and temporary cost fluctuations than more homogeneous populations do. In the latter, cascades following temporary peaks in support requests more often result in complete failure, while under full information about the risk distribution this would not have happened."
An Agent-Based Model of Motor Insurance Customer Behaviour in the UK with Word of Mouth,"Rei England, Iqbal Owadally and Douglas Wright","Insurance, Word-Of-Mouth, Agent-Based-Model, Networks, Customer Service, Renewal Premium","Attracting and retaining loyal customers is a key driver of insurance profit. An important factor is the customers' opinion of an insurer's service quality. If a customer has a bad experience with an insurer, they will be less likely to buy from them again. Word-of-mouth networks allow information to spread between customers. In this paper we build an agent-based model with two types of agents: customers and insurers. Insurers are price-takers who choose how much to spend on their service quality, and customers evaluate insurers based on premium, brand preference, and their perceived service quality. Customers are also connected in a small-world network and may share their opinions with their network. We find that the existence of the network acts as a persistent memory, causing a systemic bias whereby an insurer's early reputation achieved by random chance tends to persist and leads to unequal market shares. This occurs even when the transmission of information is very low. This suggests that newer insurers might benefit more from a higher service quality as they build their reputation. Insurers with a higher service quality earn more profit, even when the customer preference for better service quality is small. The UK regulator is intending to ban the practice of charging new customers less than renewing customers. When the model is run with this scenario, the retention rates increase substantially and there is less movement away from insurers with a good initial reputation. This increases the skewness in market concentrations, but there is a greater incentive for good service quality."
Generation of Synthetic Populations in Social Simulations: A Review of Methods and Practices,"Kevin Chapuis, Patrick Taillandier and Alexis Drogoul","Synthetic Population, Agent-Based Simulation Model Initialisation, Data-Driven Social Simulation","With the aim of building realistic model of social systems, designers of agent-based models tend to incorporate more and more data and this data is of course having an impact on their outcomes. Among these data, those concerning the attributes of social agents, which together compose synthetic populations, are particularly important, but are usually difficult to collect and therefore to use in simulations. In this paper, we review the state of the art of methodologies and theories for building realistic synthetic populations for agent-based simulation models, as well as practices in the field of social simulation. We highlight, in particular, the discrepancies between theory and practice and outline the challenges in bridging this gap using a quantitative and narrative review of work published in JASSS between 2011 and 2021. Finally, we presents some ideas that can help modelers adopt better practices regarding synthetic population generation."
On the Interplay Among Multiple Factors: Effects of Factor Configuration in a Proof-Of-Concept Migration Agent-Based Model,"Woi Sok Oh, Alvaro Carmona-Cabrero, Rafael Muñoz-Carpena and Rachata Muneepeerakul","Agent-Based Model, Human Migration, Factor Configuration, Decision-Making Process, Social Ties","Many researchers have addressed what factors should be included in their models of coupled natural-human systems (CNHSs). However, few studies have explored how these factors should be incorporated (factor configuration). Theoretical underpinning of the factor configuration may lead to a better understanding of systematic patterns and sustainable CNHS management. In particular, we ask: (1) can factor configuration explain CNHS behaviors based on its theoretical implications? and (2) when disturbed by shocks, do CNHSs respond differently under varying factor configurations? A proof-of-concept migration agent-based model (ABM) was developed and used as a platform to investigate the effects of factor configuration on system dynamics and outcomes. Here, two factors, social ties and water availability, were assumed to have alternative substitutable, complementary, or adaptable relationships in influencing migration decisions. We analyzed how populations are distributed over different regions along a water availability gradient and how regions are culturally mixed under different factor configurations. We also subjected the system to a shock scenario of dropping 50% of water availability in one region. We found that substitutability acted as a bu er against the effect of water deficiency and prevented cultural mixing of the population by keeping residents in their home regions and slowing down residential responses against the shock. Complementarity led to the sensitive migration behavior of residents, accelerating regional migration and cultural mixing. Adaptability caused residents to stay longer in new regions, which gradually led to a well-mixed cultural condition. All together, substitutability, complementarity, and adaptability gave rise to different emergent patterns. Our findings highlight the importance of how, not just what, factors are included in a CNHS ABM, a lesson that is particularly applicable to models of interdisciplinary problems where factors of diverse nature must be incorporated."
Calibrating Agent-Based Models Using Uncertainty Quantification Methods,"Josie McCulloch, Jiaqi Ge, Jonathan A. Ward, Alison Heppenstall, J. Gareth Polhill and Nick Malleson","Calibration, Optimisation, History Matching, Proximate Bayesian Computation, Uncertainty, Agent-Based Modelling","Agent-based models (ABMs) can be found across a number of diverse application areas ranging from simulating consumer behaviour to infectious disease modelling. Part of their popularity is due to their ability to simulate individual behaviours and decisions over space and time. However, whilst there are plentiful examples within the academic literature, these models are only beginning to make an impact within policy areas. Whilst frameworks such as NetLogo make the creation of ABMs relatively easy, a number of key methodological issues, including the quantification of uncertainty, remain. In this paper we draw on state-of-the-art approaches from the fields of uncertainty quantification and model optimisation to describe a novel framework for the calibration of ABMs using History Matching and Approximate Bayesian Computation. The utility of the framework is demonstrated on three example models of increasing complexity: (i) Sugarscape to illustrate the approach on a toy example; (ii) a model of the movement of birds to explore the efficacy of our framework and compare it to alternative calibration approaches and; (iii) the RISC model of farmer decision making to demonstrate its value in a real application. The results highlight the efficiency and accuracy with which this approach can be used to calibrate ABMs. This method can readily be applied to local or national-scale ABMs, such as those linked to the creation or tailoring of key policy decisions."
A Bad Barrel Spoils a Good Apple: How Uncertainty and Networks Affect Whether Matching Rules Can Foster Cooperation,"Carlos A. de Matos Fernandes, Andreas Flache, Dieko M. Bakker and Jacob Dijkstra","Cooperation, Meritocratic Matching, Information, Homophily, Threshold Model, Learning","Meritocratic matching solves the problem of cooperation by ensuring that only prosocial agents group together while excluding proselfs who are less inclined to cooperate. However, matching is less effective when estimations of individual merit rely on group-level outcomes. Prosocials in uncooperative groups are unable to change the nature of the group and are themselves forced to defect to avoid exploitation. They are then indistinguishable from proselfs, preventing them from accessing cooperative groups. We investigate informal social networks as a potential solution. Interactions in dyadic network relations provide signals of individual cooperativeness which are easier to interpret. Network relations can thus help prosocials to escape from uncooperative groups. To test our intuitions, we develop an ABM modeling cooperative behavior based on a stochastic learning model with adaptive thresholds. We investigate both randomly and homophilously formed networks. We find that homophilous networks create conditions under which meritocratic matching can function as intended. Simulation experiments identify two underlying reasons. First, dyadic network interactions in homophilous networks differentiate more between prosocials and proselfs. Second, homophilous networks create groups of prosocial agents who are aware of each other’s behavior. The stronger this prosociality segregation is, the more easily prosocials cooperate in the group context. Further analyses also highlight a downside of homophilous networks. When prosocials successfully escape from uncooperative groups, non-cooperatives have fewer encounters with prosocials, diminishing their chances to learn to cooperate through those encounters."
The Role of Reinforcement Learning in the Emergence of Conventions: Simulation Experiments with the Repeated Volunteer’s Dilemma,"Hendrik Nunner, Wojtek Przepiorka and Chris Janssen","Conventions, Repeated Games, Volunteer’s Dilemma, Agent-Based Simulation, Reinforcement Learning, Cognitive Modeling","We use reinforcement learning models to investigate the role of cognitive mechanisms in the emergence of conventions in the repeated volunteer’s dilemma (VOD). The VOD is a multi-person, binary choice collective goods game in which the contribution of only one individual is necessary and sufficient to produce a benefit for the entire group. Behavioral experiments show that in the symmetric VOD, where all group members have the same costs of volunteering, a turn-taking convention emerges, whereas in the asymmetric VOD, where one “strong” group member has lower costs of volunteering, a solitary-volunteering convention emerges with the strong member volunteering most of the time. We compare three different classes of reinforcement learning models in their ability to replicate these empirical findings. Our results confirm that reinforcement learning models can provide a parsimonious account of how humans tacitly agree on one course of action when encountering each other repeatedly in the same interaction situation. We find that considering contextual clues (i.e., reward structures) for strategy design (i.e., sequences of actions) and strategy selection (i.e., favoring equal distribution of costs) facilitate coordination when optima are less salient. Furthermore, our models produce better fits with the empirical data when agents act myopically (favoring current over expected future rewards) and the rewards for adhering to conventions are not delayed."
"Fear, Behaviour, and the COVID-19 Pandemic: A City-Scale Agent-Based Model Using Socio-Demographic and Spatial Map Data","Carl Orge Retzlaff, Laura Burbach, Lilian Kojan, Patrick Halbach, Johannes Nakayama, Martina Ziefle and André Calero Valdez","Covid-19, Epidemic Models, Pandemic Mitigation, Rescorla-Wagner Model, Health Protective Behaviour, Media Effects","Modelling infectious diseases has been shown to be of great importance and utility during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. From today's globalized information landscape, however, a plethora of new factors arise that have not been covered in previous models. In this paper, we present an agent-based model that reflects the complex interplay between the spread of a pathogen and individual protective behaviour under the influence of media messaging. We use the Rescorla-Wagner model of associative learning for the growth and extinction of fear, a factor that has been proposed as a major contributor in the determination of protective behaviour. The model space, as well as heterogeneous social structures among the agents, are created from empirical data. We incorporate factors like age, gender, wealth, and attitudes towards public health institutions. The model reproduces the empirical trends of fear and protective behaviour in Germany but struggles to simulate the accurate scale of disease spread. The decline of fear seems to promote a second wave of disease and the model suggests that individual protective behaviour has a significant impact on the outcome of the epidemic. The influence of media in the form of messages promoting protective behaviour is negligible in the model. Further research regarding factors influencing long-term protective behaviour is recommended to improve communication and mitigation strategies."
Natural-Language Multi-Agent Simulations of Argumentative Opinion Dynamics,Gregor Betz,"Opinion Dynamics, Argumentation, Natural Language Processing, Language Model","This paper develops a natural-language agent-based model of argumentation (ABMA). Its artificial deliberative agents (ADAs) are constructed with the help of so-called neural language models recently developed in AI and computational linguistics. ADAs are equipped with a minimalist belief system and may generate and submit novel contributions to a conversation. The natural-language ABMA allows us to simulate collective deliberation in English, i.e. with arguments, reasons, and claims themselves — rather than with their mathematical representations (as in symbolic models). This paper uses the natural-language ABMA to test the robustness of symbolic reason-balancing models of argumentation (Mäs & Flache 2013; Singer et al. 2019): First of all, as long as ADAs remain passive, confirmation bias and homophily updating trigger polarization, which is consistent with results from symbolic models. However, once ADAs start to actively generate new contributions, the evolution of a conversation is dominated by properties of the agents as authors. This suggests that the creation of new arguments, reasons, and claims critically affects a conversation and is of pivotal importance for understanding the dynamics of collective deliberation. The paper closes by pointing out further fruitful applications of the model and challenges for future research."
Arguments as Drivers of Issue Polarisation in Debates Among Artificial Agents,Felix Kopecky,"Polarization, Opinion Dynamics, Argumentation Strategies, Arguments, Belief Systems","Can arguments and their properties influence the development of issue polarisation in debates among artificial agents? This paper presents an agent-based model of debates with logical constraints based on the theory of dialectical structures. Simulations on this model reveal that the exchange of arguments can drive polarisation even without social influence, and that the usage of different argumentation strategies can influence the obtained levels of polarisation."
An Integrated Ecological-Social Simulation Model of Farmer Decisions and Cropping System Performance in the Rolling Pampas (Argentina),"Sebastián Pessah, Diego Omar Ferraro, Daniela Blanco and Rodrigo Castro","Land Use Change, Agent-Based Models, Cropping Systems, Emergy, Cell-DEVS","Changes in agricultural systems are a multi-causal process involving climate change, globalization and technological change. These complex interactions regulate the landscape transformation process by imposing land use and cover change (LUCC) dynamics. In order to better understand and forecast the LUCC process we developed a spatially explicit agent-based model in the form of a Cellular Automata: the AgroDEVS model. The model was designed to project viable LUCC dynamics along with their associated economic and environmental changes. AgroDEVS is structured with behavioral rules and functions representing a) crop yields, b) weather conditions, c) economic profits, d) farmer preferences, e) adoption of technology levels and f) natural resource consumption based on embodied energy accounting. Using data from a typical location of the Pampa region (Argentina) for the period 1988-2015, simulation exercises showed that economic goals were achieved, on average, each 6 out of 10 years, but environmental thresholds were only achieved in 1.9 out of 10 years. In a set of 50-years simulations, LUCC patterns converge quickly towards the most profitable crop sequences, with no noticeable trade-off between economic and environmental conditions."
PolicySpace2: Modeling Markets and Endogenous Public Policies,Bernardo Alves Furtado,"Public Policies, Real Estate Market, Agent-Based Modeling, Simulation, Spatial Analysis, Metropolitan Regions","Policymakers' role in decision making on alternative policies is facing restricted budgets and an uncertain future. The need to decide on priorities and handle effects across policies has made their task even more difficult. For instance, housing policies involve heterogeneous characteristics of the properties themselves and the intricacy of housing markets within the spatial context of cities. Here, we have proposed PolicySpace2 (PS2) as an adapted and extended version of the open source PolicySpace agent-based model. PS2 is a computer simulation that relies on empirically detailed spatial data to model real estate, along with labor, credit, and goods and services markets. Interaction among workers, firms, a bank, households and municipalities follow the literature benchmarks by integrating economic, spatial and transport research. PS2 is applied here as a comparison of three competing public policies aimed at reducing inequality and alleviating poverty: (a) house acquisition by the government and distribution to lower income households, (b) rental vouchers and (c) monetary aid. Within the model context, monetary aid, that is smaller amounts of help for a larger number of households, improves the economy in terms of production, consumption, reduction of inequality and maintenance of financial duties. PS2 is also a framework that can be further adapted to a number of related research questions."
Youth and Their Artificial Social Environmental Risk and Promotive Scores (Ya-TASERPS): An Agent-Based Model of Interactional Theory of Delinquency,JoAnn Lee and Andrew Crooks,"Agent-Based Modeling, Antisocial Behaviors, Delinquency, Risk Factors, Youth, Social Work","Risk assessments are designed to measure cumulative risk and promotive factors for delinquency and recidivism, and are used by criminal and juvenile justice systems to inform sanctions and interventions. Yet, these risk assessments tend to focus on individual risk and often fail to capture each individual’s environmental risk . This paper presents an agent-based model (ABM) which explores the interaction of individual and environmental risk on the youth. The ABM is based on an interactional theory of delinquency and moves beyond more traditional statistical approaches used to study delinquency that tend to rely on point-in-time measures, and to focus on exploring the dynamics and processes that evolve from interactions between agents (i.e., youths) and their environments. Our ABM simulates a youth’s day, where they spend time in schools, their neighborhoods, and families. The youth has proclivities for engaging in prosocial or antisocial behaviors , and their environments have likelihoods of presenting prosocial or antisocial opportunities. Results from systematically adjusting family, school, and neighborhood risk and promotive levels suggest that environmental risk and promotive factors play a role in shaping youth outcomes. As such the model shows promise for increasing our understanding of delinquency."
VIDA: A Simulation Model of Domestic Violence in Times of Social Distancing,"Lígia Mori Madeira, Bernardo Alves Furtado and Alan Dill","Domestic Violence, Violence Against Women, Agent-Based Models, Pandemics, Simulation, Metropolitan Regions","Violence against women occurs predominantly in the family and domestic context. The COVID-19 pandemic has led Brazil to recommend and at times, impose social distancing, with the partial closure of economic activities, schools, and restrictions on events and public services. Preliminary evidence shows that intense coexistence increases domestic violence, while social distancing measures may have prevented access to public services and networks, information, and help. We propose an agent-based model (ABM), called VIDA, to formalize and illustrate a multitude of factors that influence events which could trigger violence. A central part of the model is the construction of a stress indicator, created as a probability trigger of domestic violence occurring within the family environment. Having a formal model that replicates observed patterns of violence based on internal familial characteristics enables us to experiment with altering dynamics. We first tested the (a) absence or presence of the deterrence system of domestic violence against women and then (b) the existence of measures to increase social distancing. VIDA presents comparative results for metropolitan regions and neighborhoods considered in the experiments. Results suggest that social distancing measures, particularly those encouraging staying at home, may have increased domestic violence against women by about 10%. VIDA suggests further that more populated areas have comparatively fewer cases per hundred thousand women than less populous capitals or rural areas of urban concentrations. This paper contributes to the literature by formalizing, to the best of our knowledge, the first model of domestic violence through agent-based modeling, using empirical detailed socioeconomic, demographic, educational, gender, and race data at the intraurban (census sectors) and household level."
Long-Term Dynamics of Institutions: Using ABM as a Complementary Tool to Support Theory Development in Historical Studies,"Molood Ale Ebrahim Dehkordi, Amineh Ghorbani, Giangiacomo Bravo, Mike Farjam, René van Weeren, Anders Forsman and Tine De Moor","Institutional Modelling, Historical Data, CPRs, Institutional Evolution","Historical data are valuable resources for providing insights into social patterns in the past. However, these data often inform us at the macro-level of analysis but not about the role of individuals’ behaviours in the emergence of long-term patterns. Therefore, it is difficult to infer ‘how’ and ‘why’ certain patterns emerged in the past. Historians use various methods to draw hypotheses about the underlying reasons for emerging patterns and trends, but since the patterns are the results of hundreds if not thousands of years of human behaviour, these hypotheses can never be tested in reality. Our proposition is that simulation models and specifically, agent-based models (ABMs) can be used as complementary tools in historical studies to support hypothesis building. The approach that we propose and test in this paper is to design and configure models in such a way as to generate historical patterns, consequently aiming to find individual-level explanations for the emerging pattern. In this work, we use an existing, empirically validated, agent-based model of common pool resource management to test hypotheses formulated based on a historical dataset. We first investigate whether the model can replicate various patterns observed in the dataset, and second, whether it can contribute to a better understanding of the underlying mechanism that led to the observed empirical trends. We showcase how ABM can be used as a complementary tool to support theory development in historical studies. Finally, we provide some guidelines for using ABM as a tool to test historical hypotheses."
The Role of Mistrust in the Modelling of Opinion Adoption,"Johnathan Adams, Gentry White and Robyn Araujo","Opinion Dynamics, Mistrust, Bayesian Update, Polarisation, Modelling","Societies tend to partition into factions based on shared beliefs, leading to sectarian conflict in society. This paper investigates mistrust as a cause for this partitioning by extending an established opinion dynamics model with Bayesian updating that specifies mistrust as the underlying mechanism for disagreement and, ultimately, polarisation. We demonstrate that mistrust is at the foundation of polarisation. Detailed analysis and the results of rigorous simulation studies provide new insight into the potential role of mistrust in polarisation. We show that consensus results when mistrust levels are low, but introducing extreme agents makes consensus significantly harder to reach and highly fragmented and dispersed. These results also suggest a method to verify the model using real-world experimental or observational data empirically."
"Using Agent-Based Modelling to Assess Scenarios for Enhanced Soil and Water Conservation in the Boset District, Ethiopia","Samuel Assefa, Aad Kessler and Luuk Fleskens","Social Simulation, Farmers, Soil and Water Conservation, Scenario Analysis, Ethiopia","The sustainability of the ongoing Campaign-Based Watershed Management (CBWM) program in Ethiopia is questionable due to poor planning and implementation of the Soil and Water Conservation (SWC) structures. This study uses an empirically based, agent-based model to explore the effect of six scenarios on both area of land covered by, as well as the quality of SWC structures in three Kebeles (villages) of Boset District. The analysis revealed that integrating multiple interventions enhanced SWC most in all Kebeles. Furthermore, increasing the commitment of local government through capacity building generated most effect and yet required the lowest investment. Motivating farmers, introducing alternative livelihood opportunities and establishing and strengthening micro-watershed associations had limited, but differential influence on the outcomes across the Kebeles. However, all alternative scenarios had some added value compared to doing business as usual. Hence, in order to enhance the outcomes and sustainability of the ongoing CBWM program in the study area and other similar localities, it is crucial to pay much more attention to increasing the commitment of local government actors through capacity building. This empowers local government actors to (1) plan and more efficiently implement the program in consultation with other local actors, and (2) integrate locally sensitive need-based adaptation of the program."
The Dynamical Relation Between Individual Needs and Group Performance: A Simulation of the Self-Organising Task Allocation Process,"Shaoni Wang, Kees Zoethout, Wander Jager and Yanzhong Dang","Individual Needs, Motivation, Group Performance, Self-Organization, Task Allocation, Agent-Based Modelling","Team performance can be considered a macro-level outcome that depends on three sets of micro-level factors: individual workers contributing to the task, team composition, and task characteristics. For a number of reasons, the complex dynamics between individuals in the task allocation process are difficult to systematically explore in traditional experimental settings:  the motivational dynamics, the complex dynamics of task allocation processes, and the lack of experimental control over team composition imply an ABM-approach being more feasible. For this reason, we propose an updated version of the WORKMATE model that has been developed to explore the dynamics of team performance. In doing so, we added Deci and Ryan’s SDT theory, stating that people are motivated by three psychological needs, competence, autonomy, and belongingness. This paper is aimed at explaining the architecture of the model, and some first simulation runs as proof of concept. The experimental results show that: 1) an appropriate motivation threshold will help the team have the lowest performance time. 2) the time needed for the task allocation process is related to the importance of different motivations. 3) highly satisfied teams are more likely composed of members valuing autonomy."
"Hard Work, Risk-Taking, and Diversity in a Model of Collective Problem Solving",Amin Boroomand and Paul E. Smaldino,"Teams, NK Landscape, Risk, Collective Decision Making, Agent-Based Model","We studied an agent-based model of collective problem solving in which teams of agents search on an NK landscape and share information about newly found solutions. We analyzed the effects of team members’ behavioral strategies, team size, and team diversity on overall performance. Depending on the landscape complexity and a team’s features a team may eventually find the best possible solution or become trapped at a local maximum. Hard-working agents can explore more solutions per unit time, while risk-taking agents inject randomness in the solutions they test. We found that when teams solve complex problems, both strategies (risk-taking and hard work) have positive impacts on the final score, and the positive effect of moderate risk-taking is substantial. However, risk-taking has a negative effect on how quickly a team achieves its final score. If time restrictions can be relaxed, a moderate level of risk can produce an improved score. If the highest priority is instead to achieve the best possible score in the shortest amount of time, the hard work strategy has the greatest impact. When problems are simpler, risk-taking behavior has a negative effect on performance, while hard work decreases the time required to solve the problem. We also find that larger teams generally solved problems more effectively, and that some of this positive effect is due to the increase in diversity. We show more generally that increasing the diversity of teams has a positive impact on the team’s final score, while more diverse teams also require less time to reach their final solution. This work contributes overall to the larger literature on collective problem solving in teams."
A Noisy Opinion Formation Model with Two Opposing Mass Media,Hirofumi Takesue,"Opinion Dynamics, Continuous Opinions, Noise, Mass Media","Processes of individual attitude formation and their macroscopic consequences have become an intriguing research topic, and agent-based models of opinion formation have been proposed to understand this phenomenon. This study conducted an agent-based simulation and examined the role of mass media in a noisy opinion formation process, where opinion heterogeneity is preserved by a weak intensity of assimilation and errors accompanying opinion modifications. In a computational model, agents conformed to their neighbours' opinions in social networks. In addition, each agent tended to be influenced by one of a two external agents with fixed opinions, that is, mass media that take opposite positions on an opinion spectrum. The simulation results demonstrated that a small probability of interactions with mass media reduces opinion heterogeneity even with extreme mass media position values. However, a large frequency of interactions with mass media increases opinion heterogeneity. Accordingly, intermediate assimilation strength achieves the least heterogeneous opinion distribution. The influence of mass media dampens the effects of network topology. Our simulation implies that mass media can play qualitatively different roles depending on their positions and intensity of influence."
Cultural Dissemination: An Agent-Based Model with Social Influence,"Ngan Nguyen, Hongfei Chen, Benjamin Jin, Walker Quinn, Conrad Tyler and Adam Landsberg","Cultural Dissemination, Agent-Based Modeling, Cultural Evolution, Opinion Dynamics, Cultural Transmission, Bounded Confidence Models","We study cultural dissemination in the context of an Axelrod-like agent-based model describing the spread of cultural traits across a society, with an added element of social influence. This modification produces absorbing states exhibiting greater variation in number and size of distinct cultural regions compared to the original Axelrod model, and we identify the mechanism responsible for this amplification in heterogeneity. We develop several new metrics to quantitatively characterize the heterogeneity and geometric qualities of these absorbing states. Additionally, we examine the dynamical approach to absorbing states in both our Social Influence Model as well as the Axelrod Model, which not only yields interesting insights into the differences in behavior of the two models over time, but also provides a more comprehensive view into the behavior of Axelrod's original model. The quantitative metrics introduced in this paper have broad potential applicability across a large variety of agent-based cultural dissemination models."
Social Network Metric-Based Interventions? Experiments with an Agent-Based Model of the COVID-19 Pandemic in a Metropolitan Region,"Ben Vermeulen, Matthias Müller and Andreas Pyka","Epidemic, Agent-Based Model, Policy Laboratory, COVID-19, Coronavirus","We present and use an agent-based model to study interventions for suppression, mitigation, and vaccination in coping with the COVID-19 pandemic. Unlike metapopulation models, our agent-based model permits experimenting with micro-level interventions in social interactions at individual sites. We compare common macro-level interventions applicable to everyone (e.g., keep distance, close all schools) to targeted interventions in the social network spanned by households based on specific (potential) transmission rates (e.g., prohibit visiting spreading hubs or bridging ties). We show that, in the simulation environment, micro-level measures of 'locking' of a number of households and ‘blocking’ access to a number of sites (e.g., workplaces, schools, recreation areas) using social network centrality metrics permits refined control on the positioning on the immunity-mortality curve. In simulation results, social network metric-based vaccination of households offers refined control and reduces the spread saliently better than random vaccination."
Agent-Based Social Simulation of the Covid-19 Pandemic: A Systematic Review,"Fabian Lorig, Emil Johansson and Paul Davidsson","SARS-CoV-2, Transmission Processes, Effects of Interventions, Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions, Literature Study, PRISMA","When planning interventions to limit the spread of Covid-19, the current state of knowledge about the disease and specific characteristics of the population need to be considered. Simulations can facilitate policy making as they take prevailing circumstances into account. Moreover, they allow for the investigation of the potential effects of different interventions using an artificial population. Agent-based Social Simulation (ABSS) is argued to be particularly useful as it can capture the behavior of and interactions between individuals. We performed a systematic literature review and identified 126 articles that describe ABSS of Covid-19 transmission processes. Our review showed that ABSS is widely used for investigating the spread of Covid-19. Existing models are very heterogeneous with respect to their purpose, the number of simulated individuals, and the modeled geographical region as well as how they model transmission dynamics, disease states, human behavior, and interventions. To this end, a discrepancy can be identified between the needs of policy makers and what is implemented by the simulation models. This also includes how thoroughly the models consider and represent the real-world, e.g., in terms of factors that affect the transmission probability or how humans make decisions. Shortcomings were also identified in the transparency of the presented models, e.g., in terms of documentation or availability, as well as in their validation, which might limit their suitability for supporting decision-making processes.

Gareth Polhill, Matthew Hare, Tom Bauermann, David Anzola, Erika Palmer, Doug Salt and Patrycja Antosz","Prediction, Complex Systems, Wicked Systems, Agent-Based Modelling, Cellular Automata, Turing Machines","This paper uses two thought experiments to argue that the complexity of the systems to which agent-based models (ABMs) are often applied is not the central source of difficulties ABMs have with prediction. We define various levels of predictability, and argue that insofar as path-dependency is a necessary attribute of a complex system, ruling out states of the system means that there is at least the potential to say something useful. ‘Wickedness’ is argued to be a more significant challenge to prediction than complexity. Critically, however, neither complexity nor wickedness makes prediction theoretically impossible in the sense of being formally undecidable computationally-speaking: intractable being the more apt term given the exponential sizes of the spaces being searched. However, endogenous ontological novelty in wicked systems is shown to render prediction futile beyond the immediately short term."
Comparing Mechanisms of Food Choice in an Agent-Based Model of Milk Consumption and Substitution in the UK,"Matthew Gibson, Raphael Slade, Joana Portugal Pereira and Joeri Rogelj","Food Choice, Milk Consumption, Consumer Behaviour, Agent-Based Modelling, Calibration Optimisation, Global Temporal Sensitivity Analysis","Substitution of food products will be key to realising widespread adoption of sustainable diets. We present an agent-based model of decision-making and influences on food choice, and apply it to historically observed trends of British whole and skimmed (including semi) milk consumption from 1974 to 2005. We aim to give a plausible representation of milk choice substitution, and test different mechanisms of choice consideration. Agents are consumers that perceive information regarding the two milk choices, and hold values that inform their position on the health and environmental impact of those choices. Habit, social influence and post-decision evaluation are modelled. Representative survey data on human values and long-running public concerns empirically inform the model. An experiment was run to compare two model variants by how they perform in reproducing these trends. This was measured by recording mean weekly milk consumption per person. The variants differed in how agents became disposed to consider alternative milk choices. One followed a threshold approach, the other was probability based. All other model aspects remained unchanged. An optimisation exercise via an evolutionary algorithm was used to calibrate the model variants independently to observed data. Following calibration, uncertainty and global variance-based temporal sensitivity analysis were conducted. Both model variants were able to reproduce the general pattern of historical milk consumption, however, the probability-based approach gave a closer fit to the observed data, but over a wider range of uncertainty. This responds to, and further highlights, the need for research that looks at, and compares, different models of human decision-making in agent-based and simulation models. This study is the first to present an agent-based modelling of food choice substitution in the context of British milk consumption. It can serve as a valuable pre-curser to the modelling of dietary shift and sustainable product substitution to plant-based alternatives in Britain."
Cascades Across Networks Are Sufficient for the Formation of Echo Chambers: An Agent-Based Model,Jan-Philipp Fränken and Toby Pilditch,"Echo Chambers, Source Credibility, Information Cascades, Agent-Based Modelling, Bayesian Modelling, Single Interaction","Investigating how echo chambers emerge in social networks is increasingly crucial, given their role in facilitating the retention of misinformation, inducing intolerance towards opposing views, and misleading public and political discourse. Previously, the emergence of echo chambers has been attributed to psychological biases and inter-individual differences, requiring repeated interactions among network-users and rewiring or pruning of social ties. Using an idealised population of social network users, the present results suggest that when combined with positive credibility perceptions of a communicating source, social media users’ ability to rapidly share information with each other through a single cascade can be sufficient to produce echo chambers. Crucially, we show that this requires neither special psychological explanation (e.g., bias or individual differences), nor repeated interactions—though these may be exacerbating factors. In fact, this effect is made increasingly worse the more generations of peer-to-peer transmissions it takes for information to permeate a network. This raises important questions for social network architects, if truly opposed to the increasing prevalence of deleterious societal trends that stem from echo chamber formation."
Sustaining Collective Action in Urban Community Gardens,"Arthur Feinberg, Elena Hooijschuur, Nicole Rogge, Amineh Ghorbani and Paulien Herder","Community Gardens, Agent-Based Model, Institutional Modelling, Theory of Reasoned Action, Design Principles for Collective Action","This paper presents an agent-based model that explores the conditions for ongoing participation in community gardening projects. We tested the effects of Ostrom's well-known Design Principles for collective action and used an extensive database collected in 123 cases in Germany and two case studies in the Netherlands to validate it. The model used the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework and integrated decision mechanisms derived from the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA). This allowed us to analyse volunteer participation in urban community gardens over time, based on the garden's institutions (Design Principles) and the volunteer's intention to join gardening. This intention was influenced by the volunteer's expectations and past experiences in the garden (TRA). We found that not all Design Principles lead to higher levels of participation but rather, participation depends on specific combinations of the Design Principles. We highlight the need to update the assumption about sanctioning in such systems: sanctioning is not always beneficial, and may be counter-productive in certain contexts."
Actor Behaviour and Robustness of Industrial Symbiosis Networks: An Agent-Based Modelling Approach,"Kasper Lange, Gijsbert Korevaar, Igor Nikolic and Paulien Herder","Circular Economy, Industrial Symbiosis, Cooperative Networks, Agent-Based Modelling, Theory of Planned Behaviour, Eco-Oriented Behaviour","Industrial Symbiosis Networks (ISNs) consist of firms that exchange residual materials and energy locally, in order to gain economic, environmental and/or social advantages. In practice, ISNs regularly fail when partners leave and the recovery of residual streams ends. Regarding the current societal need for a shift towards sustainability, it is undesirable that ISNs should fail. Failures of ISNs may be caused by actor behaviour that leads to unanticipated economic losses. In this paper, we explore the effect of these behaviours on ISN robustness by using an agent-based model (ABM). The constructed model is based on insights from both literature and participatory modelling in three real-world cases. It simulates the implementation of synergies for local waste exchange and compost production. The Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) was used to model agent behaviour in time-dependent bilateral negotiations and synergy evaluation processes. We explored model behaviour with and without TPB logic across a range of possible TPB input variables. The simulation results show how the modelled planned behaviour affects the cash flow outcomes of the social agents and the robustness of the network. The study contributes to the theoretical development of industrial symbiosis research by providing a quantitative model of all ISN implementation stages, in which various behavioural patterns of entrepreneurs are included. It also contributes to practice by offering insights on how network dynamics and robustness outcomes are not only related to context and ISN design, but also to actor behaviour."
Understanding the Effects of China’s Agro-Environmental Policies on Rural Households’ Labor and Land Allocation with a Spatially Explicit Agent-Based Model,"Ying Wang, Qi Zhang, Srikanta Sannigrahi, Qirui Li, Shiqi Tao, Richard Bilsborrow, Jiangfeng Li and Conghe Song","Spatially Explicit Agent-Based Model, Social-Ecological Systems, Land Use, Labor Allocation, Agro-Environmental Policies","Understanding household labor and land allocation decisions under agro-environmental policies is challenging due to complex human-environment interactions. Here, we developed a spatially explicit agent-based model based on spatial and socioeconomic data to simulate households’ land and labor allocation decisions and investigated the impacts of two forest restoration and conservation programs and one agricultural subsidy program in rural China. Simulation outputs revealed that the forest restoration program accelerates labor out-migration and cropland shrink, while the forest conservation program promotes livelihood diversification via increasing non-farm employment. Meanwhile, the agricultural subsidy program keeps labor for cultivation on land parcels with good quality, but appears less effective for preventing marginal croplands from being abandoned. The policy effects on labor allocation substantially differ between rules based on bounded rational and empirical knowledge of defining household decisions, particularly on sending labor out-migrants and engaging in local off-farm jobs. Land use patterns showed that the extent to which households pursue economic benefits through shrinking cultivated land is generally greater under bounded rationality than empirical knowledge. Findings demonstrate nonlinear social-ecological impacts of the agro-environmental policies through time, which can deviate from expectations due to complex interplays between households and land. This study also suggests that the spatial agent-based model can represent adaptive decision-making and interactions of human agents and their interactions in dynamic social and physical environments."
Modeling COVID-19 for Lifting Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions,"Matthew Koehler, David M Slater, Garry Jacyna and James R Thompson","Agent-Based Modeling, Covid-19, Contact Networks, Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions","As a result of the COVID-19 worldwide pandemic, the United States instituted various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in an effort to slow the spread of the disease. Although necessary for public safety, these NPIs can also have deleterious effects on the economy of a nation. State and federal leaders need tools that provide insight into which combination of NPIs will have the greatest impact on slowing the disease and at what point in time it is reasonably safe to start lifting these restrictions to everyday life. In the present work, we outline a modeling process that incorporates the parameters of the disease, the effects of NPIs, and the characteristics of individual communities to offer insight into when and to what degree certain NPIs should be instituted or lifted based on the progression of a given outbreak of COVID-19. We apply the model to the 24 county-equivalents of Maryland and illustrate that different NPI strategies can be employed in different parts of the state. Our objective is to outline a modeling process that combines the critical disease factors and factors relevant to decision-makers who must balance the health of the population with the health of the economy."
Where Does Theory Have It Right? A Comparison of Theory-Driven and Empirical Agent Based Models,"Firouzeh Taghikhah, Tatiana Filatova and Alexey Voinov","Model Comparison Framework, Pro-Environmental Behavior, Policy Development, Theoretical Vs. Empirical Models, Organic Food","Computational social science has witnessed a shift from pure theoretical to empirical agent-based models (ABMs) grounded in data-driven correlations between behavioral factors defining agents' decisions. There is a strong urge to go beyond theoretical ABMs with behavioral theories setting stylized rules that guide agents' actions, especially when it concerns policy-related simulations. However, it remains unclear to what extent theory-driven ABMs mislead, if at all, a choice of a policy when compared to the outcomes of models with empirical micro-foundations. This is especially relevant for pro-environmental policies that increasingly rely on quantifying cumulative effects of individual behavioral changes, where ABMs are so helpful. We propose a comparison framework to address this methodological dilemma, which quantitatively explores the gap in predictions between theory- and data-driven ABMs. Inspired by the existing theory-driven model, ORVin-T, which studies the individual choice between organic and conventional products, we design a survey to collect data on individual preferences and purchasing decisions. We then use this extensive empirical microdata to build an empirical twin, ORVin-E, replacing the theoretical assumptions and secondary aggregated data used to parametrize agents' decision strategies with our empirical survey data. We compare the models in terms of key outputs, perform sensitivity analysis, and explore three policy scenarios. We observe that the theory-driven model predicts the shifts to organic consumption as accurately as the ABM with empirical micro-foundations at both aggregated and individual scales. There are slight differences (±5%) between the estimations of the two models with regard to different behavioral change scenarios: increasing conventional tax, launching organic social-informational campaigns, and their combination. Our findings highlight the goodness of fit and usefulness of theoretical modeling efforts, at least in the case of incremental behavioral change. It sheds light on the conditions when theory-driven and data-driven models are aligned and on the value of empirical data for studying systemic changes."
Can Ethnic Tolerance Curb Self-Reinforcing School Segregation? A Theoretical Agent Based Model,Lucas Sage and Andreas Flache,"Agent-Based Model, Social Simulation, Segregation, School-Segregation, School-Choice, Discrete-Choice-Model","Schelling and Sakoda prominently proposed computational models suggesting that strong ethnic residential segregation can be the unintended outcome of a self-reinforcing dynamic driven by choices of individuals with rather tolerant ethnic preferences. There are only few attempts to apply this view to school choice, another important arena in which ethnic segregation occurs. In the current paper, we explore with an agent-based theoretical model similar to those proposed for residential segregation, how ethnic tolerance among parents can affect the level of school segregation. More specifically, we ask whether and under which conditions school segregation could be reduced if more parents hold tolerant ethnic preferences. We move beyond earlier models of school segregation in three ways. First, we model individual school choices using a random utility discrete choice approach. Second, we vary the pattern of ethnic segregation in the residential context of school choices systematically, comparing residential maps in which segregation is unrelated to parents’ level of tolerance to residential maps reflecting their ethnic preferences. Third, we introduce heterogeneity in tolerance levels among parents belonging to the same group. Our simulation experiments suggest that ethnic school segregation can be a very robust phenomenon, occurring even when about half of the population prefers segregated to mixed schools. However, we also identify a “sweet spot” in the parameter space in which a larger proportion of tolerant parents makes the biggest difference. This is the case when parents have moderate preferences for nearby schools and there is only little residential segregation. Further experimentation unraveled the underlying mechanisms."
Dynamics of Public Opinion: Diverse Media and Audiences’ Choices,Zhongtian Chen and Hanlin Lan,"Opinion Dynamics, Social Media, Polarization, Agent-Based Modeling, Opinion Guidance","Studies on the fundamental role of diverse media in the evolution of public opinion can protect us from the spreading of brainwashing, extremism, and terrorism. Many fear the information cocoon may result in polarization of the public opinion. Hence, in this work, we investigate how audiences' choices among diverse media might influence public opinion. Specifically, we aim to figure out how peoples' horizons (i.e., range of available media) and quantity, as well as the distribution of media, may shape the space of public opinion. We propose a novel model of opinion dynamics that considers different influences and horizons for every individual, and we carry out simulations using a real-world social network. Numerical simulations show that diversity in media can provide more choices to the people, although individuals only choose media within the bounds of their horizons, extreme opinions are more diluted, and no opinion polarizations emerge. Furthermore, we find that the distribution of media's opinions can effectively influence the space for public opinion, but when the number of media grows to a certain level, its effect will reach a limitation. Finally, we show that the effect of campaigns for consciousness or education can be improved by constructing the opinion of media, which can provide a basis for the policy maker in the new media age."
The Use of Surrogate Models to Analyse Agent-Based Models,"Guus ten Broeke, George van Voorn, Arend Ligtenberg and Jaap Molenaar","Sensitivity Analysis, Surrogate Model, Support Vector Machine, Model Analysis","The utility of Agent Based Models (ABMs) for decision making support as well as for scientific applications can be increased considerably by the availability and use of methodologies for thorough model behaviour analysis. In view of their intrinsic construction, ABMs have to be analysed numerically. Furthermore, ABM behaviour is often complex, featuring strong non-linearities, tipping points, and adaptation. This easily leads to high computational costs, presenting a serious practical limitation. Model developers and users alike would benefit from methodologies that can explore large parts of parameter space at limited computational costs. In this paper we present a methodology that makes this possible. The essence of our approach is to develop a cost-effective surrogate model based on ABM output using machine learning to approximate ABM simulation data. The development consists of two steps, both with iterative loops of training and cross-validation. In the first part, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) is developed to split behaviour space into regions of qualitatively different behaviour. In the second part, a Support Vector Regression (SVR) is developed to cover the quantitative behaviour within these regions. Finally, sensitivity indices are calculated to rank the importance of parameters for describing the boundaries between regions, and for the quantitative dynamics within regions. The methodology is demonstrated in three case studies, a differential equation model of predator-prey interaction, a common-pool resource ABM and an ABM representing the Philippine tuna fishery. In all cases, the model and the corresponding surrogate model show a good match. Furthermore, different parameters are shown to influence the quantitative outcomes, compared to those that influence the underlying qualitative behaviour. Thus, the method helps to distinguish which parameters determine the boundaries in parameter space between regions that are separated by tipping points, or by any criterion of interest to the user."
No Free Lunch when Estimating Simulation Parameters,Ernesto Carrella,"Estimation, Calibration, Approximate Bayesian Computation, Random Forest, Generalized Additive Model, Bootstrap","In this paper, we have estimated the parameters of 41 simulation models to find which of 9 estimation algorithms performs better. Unfortunately, no single algorithm was the best for all or even most of the models. Rather, five main results emerge from this research. First, each algorithm was the best estimator for at least one parameter. Second, the best estimation algorithm varied not only between models but even between parameters of the same model. Third, each estimation algorithm failed to estimate at least one identifiable parameter. Fourth, choosing the right algorithm improved estimation performance by more than quadrupling the number of model runs. Fifth, half of the agent-based models tested could not be fully identified. We therefore argue that the testing performed here should be done in other applied work and to facilitate this we would like to share the R package 'freelunch'."
An Agent Based Model of a Thinly Traded Land Market in an Urbanizing Region,"Yong Chen, Elena Irwin, Ciriyam Jayaprakash and Kyoung Jin Park","Scattered Development, Leapfrog, Land Use, Amenities, Spatial Competition, Auction","We have developed a model of a multi-period agent-based land market based on the theory of thinly traded land markets. This new model builds upon the stylized fact that land demand (supply) decreases (increases) across the urban-rural gradient. The effect of heterogeneous amenities are also included in the model.  We simulated the model for a growing urbanizing region and investigated the evolution of land development patterns. We found that this simple model can replicate/reproduce many interesting observed features. For instance, scattered development can emerge in transitory periods due to the land demand (supply) decreases (increases) over the urban-rural gradient. Furthermore, increases in transportation costs and the number of in-migrants tend to decrease both the intensity and persistence of scattered development."
Introducing the Argumentation Framework Within Agent-Based Models to Better Simulate Agents' Cognition in Opinion Dynamics: Application to Vegetarian Diet Diffusion,"Patrick Taillandier, Nicolas Salliou and Rallou Thomopoulos","Opinion Dynamics, Agent-Based Simulation, Argumentation Framework, Vegetarian Diets","This paper introduces a generic agent-based model simulating the exchange and the diffusion of pro and con arguments. It is applied to the case of the diffusion of vegetarian diets in the context of a potential emergence of a second nutrition transition. To this day, agent-based simulation has been extensively used to study opinion dynamics. However, the vast majority of existing models have been limited to extremely abstract and simplified representations of the diffusion process. These simplifications impairs the realism of the simulations and disables the understanding of the reasons for the shift of an actor's opinion. The generic model presented here explicitly represents exchanges of arguments between actors in the context of an opinion dynamic model. In particular, the inner attitude towards an opinion of each agent is formalized as an argumentation graph and each agent can share arguments with other agents. Simulation experiments show that introducing attacks between arguments and a limitation of the number of arguments mobilized by agents has a strong impact on the evolution of the agents' opinion. We also highlight that when a new argument is introduced into the system, the quantity and the profile of the agents receiving the new argument will impact the evolution of the overall opinion. Finally, the application of this model to vegetarian diet adoption seems consistent with historical food behaviour dynamics observed during crises."
Generating a Two-Layered Synthetic Population for French Municipalities: Results and Evaluation of Four Synthetic Reconstruction Methods,"Boyam Fabrice Yameogo, Pierre-Olivier Vandanjon, Pascal Gastineau and Pierre Hankach","Synthetic Population Generation, Multi-Level, Microsimulation, Simultaneous Control","This article describes the generation of a detailed two-layered synthetic population of households and individuals for French municipalities. Using French census data, four synthetic reconstruction methods associated with two probabilistic integerization methods are applied. The paper offers an in-depth description of each method through a common framework. A comparison of these methods is then carried out on the basis of various criteria. Results showed that the tested algorithms produce realistic synthetic populations with the most efficient synthetic reconstruction methods assessed being the Hierarchical Iterative Proportional Fitting and the relative entropy minimization algorithms. Combined with the Truncation Replication Sampling allocation method for performing integerization, these algorithms generate household-level and individual-level data whose values lie closest to those of the actual population."

It was developed to support local authorities in North East England who are making decisions in a fast moving crisis with limited access to data. The proximate purpose of <i>JuSt-Social</i> is description, as the model represents knowledge about both COVID-19 transmission and intervention effects. Its ultimate purpose is to generate stories that respond to the questions and concerns of local planners and policy makers and are justified by the quality of the representation. These <i>justified stories</i> organise the knowledge in way that is accessible, timely and useful at the local level, assisting the decision makers to better understand both their current situation and the plausible outcomes of policy alternatives. <i>JuSt-Social</i> and the concept of <i>justified stories</i> apply to the modelling of infectious disease in general and, even more broadly, modelling in public health, particularly for policy interventions in complex systems."
Agent-Based Simulation of West Asian Urban Dynamics: Impact of Refugees,"Ali Termos, Stefano Picascia and Neil Yorke-Smith","Rent-Gap Theory, Migration, Agent-Based Modelling, Urban Dynamics, Housing, Lebanon","Rapid international migration of significant populations generates profound implications for countries in West Asia, Europe, and other regions. The motivation of this work is to develop an agent-based model (ABM) to capture the existence of such migrant and refugee flows, and to explore the effects of these flows on urban dynamics. Advances in agent-based modelling have led to theoretically-grounded spatial agent models of urban dynamics, capturing the dynamics of population, property prices, and regeneration. In this article we leverage such an extant agent-based model founded on the rent-gap theory, as a lens to study the effect of sizeable refugee migration upon a capital city in West Asia. In order to calibrate and validate the simulation model we construct indices for housing prices and other factors. Results from the model, implemented in NetLogo, show the impact of migration shock on the housing market, and identify the relative efficacy of housing intervention policies. Our work progresses towards a tool for policy makers asking what-if questions about the urban environment in the context of migration."
On the Macroeconomic Effect of Extortion: An Agent-Based Approach,"Alejandro Platas-López, Alejandro Guerra-Hernández and Francisco Grimaldo","Extortion, Macroeconomic Signals, BAM, Agent-Based Model","This work proposes an agent-based approach to study the effect of extortion on macroeconomic aggregates, despite the fact that there is little data on this criminal activity given its hidden nature. We develop a Bottom-up Adaptive Macroeconomics (BAM) model that simulates a healthy economy, including a moderate inflation and a reasonable unemployment rate, and test the impact of extortion on various macroeconomic signals. The BAM model defines the usual interactions among workers, firms and banks in labour, goods and credit markets. Subsequently, crime is introduced by defining the propensity of the poorest workers to become extortionists, as well as the efficiency of the police in terms of their probability of capturing these extortionists. The definition of BAM under Extortion Racket Systems (BAMERS) model is completed with a threshold for the firms rejecting extortion. These parameters are explored extensively and independently. Results show that even low propensity towards extortion is enough to find considerable negative effects such as a marked contraction of Gross Domestic Product and increased unemployment, consistent with the little known data of the macroeconomic effects of extortion. The effects on consumption, Gini index, inflation and wealth distribution are also reported. Interestingly, our results suggest that it is more convenient to prevent extortion, rather than combat it once deployed, i.e., no police efficiency level achieves the healthy macroeconomic signals observed without extortion."
Opinion Dynamics and Collective Risk Perception: An Agent-Based Model of Institutional and Media Communication About Disasters,Francesca Giardini and Daniele Vilone,"Risk Perceptions, Opinion Dynamics, Social Influence, Agent-Based Model","The behavior of a heterogeneous population of individuals during an emergency, such as epidemics, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, is dynamic, emergent and complex. In this situation, reducing uncertainty about the event is crucial in order to identify and pursue the best possible course of action. People depend on  experts, government sources, the media and fellow community members as potentially valid sources of information to reduce uncertainty, but their messages can be ambiguous, misleading or contradictory. Effective risk prevention depends on the way in which the population receives, elaborates and spread the message, and together these elements result in a collective perception of risk. The interaction between individuals' attitudes toward risk and institutions, the more or less alarmist way in which the information is reported and the role of the media can lead to risk perception that differs from the original message, as well as to contrasting opinions about risk within the same population. The aim of this study is to bridge a model of opinion dynamics with the issue of uncertainty and trust in the sources, in order to understand the determinants of collective risk assessment. Our results show that alarming information spreads more easily than reassuring one, and that the media plays a key role in this. Concerning the role of internal variables, our simulation results show that risk sensitiveness has more influence on the final opinion than trust towards the institutional message. Furthermore, the role of different network structures seemed to be negligible, even on two empirically calibrated network topologies, thus suggesting that knowing beforehand how much the public trusts their institutional representatives and how reactive they are to a certain risk might provide useful indications to design more effective communication strategies during crises."
An Argument Communication Model of Polarization and Ideological Alignment,Sven Banisch and Eckehard Olbrich,"Argument Communication Theory, Opinion Dynamics, Polarisation, Ideological Alignment, Belief Systems, Cognitive-Evaluative Maps","This multi-level model of opinion formation considers that attitudes on diﬀerent issues are usually not independent. In the model, agents exchange beliefs regarding a series of facts. A cognitive structure of evaluative associations links diﬀerent (partially overlapping) sets of facts on diﬀerent political issues and determines agents’ attitudinal positions in a way borrowed from expectancy value theory. If agents preferentially interact with other agents who hold similar attitudes on one or several issues, this leads to biased argument pools and increasing polarization in the sense that groups of agents selectively believe in distinct subsets of facts. Besides the emergence of a bi-modal distribution of opinions on single issues as most previous opinion polarization models address, our model also accounts for the alignment of attitudes across several issues along ideological dimensions."
Finding Core Members of Cooperative Games Using Agent-Based Modeling,Daniele Vernon-Bido and Andrew Collins,"Agent-Based Modeling, Cooperative Game Theory, Modeling and Simulation, ABM, Cooperative Games","Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a powerful paradigm to gain insight into social phenomena. One area that ABM has rarely been applied is coalition formation. Traditionally, coalition formation is modelled using cooperative game theory. In this paper, a heuristic algorithm, which can be embedded into an ABM to allow the agents to find a coalition, is described. Our heuristic algorithm combines agent-based modeling and cooperative game theory to help find agent partitions that are members of a games' core solutions (if they exist). The accuracy of our heuristic algorithm can be determined by comparing its outcomes to the actual core solutions. This comparison is achieved by developing an experiment that uses a specific example of a cooperative game called the glove game. The glove game is a type of market economy game.  Finding the traditional cooperative game solutions is computationally intensive for large numbers of players because each possible partition must be compared to each possible coalition to determine the core set; hence our experiment only considers up to nine-player games. The results indicate that our heuristic approach achieves a core solution over 90% of the games considered in our experiment."
Targeting Your Preferences: Modelling Micro-Targeting for an Increasingly Diverse Electorate,Toby Pilditch and Jens Koed Madsen,"Micro-Targeted Campaigning, Cognitive Modelling, Source Credibility, Political Messaging, Simulation, Bayesian Modelling","The use of data to inform and run political campaigning has become an inescapable trend in recent years. In attempting to persuade an electorate, micro-targeted campaigns (MTCs) have been employed to great effect through the use of tailored messaging and selective targeting. Here we investigate the capacity of MTCs to deal with the diversity of political preferences across an electorate. More precisely, via an Agent-Based Model we simulate various diverse electorates that encompass single issue, multiple issue, swing, and disengaged voters (among others, including combinations thereof) and determine the relative persuasive efficacy of MTCs when pitted against more traditional, population-targeting campaigns. Taking into account the perceived credibility of these campaigns, we find MTCs highly capable of handling greater voter complexity than shown in previous work, and yielding further advantages beyond traditional campaigns in their capacity to avoid inefficient (or even backfiring) interactions – even when fielding a low credibility candidate."
Halting SARS-CoV-2 by Targeting High-Contact Individuals,Gianluca Manzo and Arnout van de Rijt,"Agent-Based Computational Models, Complex Social Networks, Virus Diffusion, Immunization Strategies, Epidemiological Models","Network scientists have proposed that infectious diseases involving person-to-person transmission could be effectively halted by interventions targeting a minority of highly connected individuals. Could this strategy be effective in combating a virus partly transmitted in close-range contact, as many believe SARS-CoV-2 to be? Effectiveness critically depends on high between-person variability in the number of close-range contacts. We analyzed population survey data showing that the distribution of close-range contacts across individuals is indeed characterized by a small proportion of individuals reporting very high frequency contacts. Strikingly, we found that the average duration of contact is mostly invariant in the number of contacts, reinforcing the criticality of hubs. We simulated a population embedded in a network with empirically observed contact frequencies. Simulations showed that targeting hubs robustly improves containment."
The Unknown of the Pandemic: An Agent-Based Model of Final Phase Risks,Marco Cremonini and Samira Maghool,"Stochastic Epidemic Model, Multi-Agent Simulation, Network Analysis, Agent-Based Model, Risk Analysis","Lifting social restrictions is one of the most critical decisions that public health authorities have to face during a pandemic such as COVID-19. This work focuses on the risk associated with such a decision. We have called the period from the re-opening decision to epidemic expiration the ’final epidemic phase’, and considered the critical epidemic conditions which could possibly emerge in this phase. The factors we have considered include: the proportion of asymptomatic cases, a mitigation strategy based on testing and the average duration of infectious states. By assuming hypothetical configurations at the time of the re-opening decision and the partial knowledge concerning epidemic dynamics available to public health authorities, we have analyzed the risk of the re-opening decision based on possibly unreliable estimates. We have presented a discrete-time stochastic model with state-dependent transmission probabilities and multi-agent simulations. Our results show the different outcomes produced by different proportions of undetected asymptomatic cases, different probabilities of asymptomatic cases detected and contained, and a multivariate analysis of risk based on the average duration of asymptomatic and contained states. Finally, our analysis highlights that enduring uncertainty, typical of this pandemic, requires a risk analysis approach to complement epidemiological studies."
RecovUS: An Agent-Based Model of Post-Disaster Household Recovery,Saeed Moradi and Ali Nejat,"Disaster Recovery, Recovery Modeling, Agent-Based Modeling, Perceived Community","The housing sector is an important part of every community. It directly affects people, constitutes a major share of the building market, and shapes the community. Meanwhile, the increase of developments in hazard-prone areas along with the intensification of extreme events has amplified the potential for disaster-induced losses. Consequently, housing recovery is of vital importance to the overall restoration of a community. In this relation, recovery models can help with devising data-driven policies that can better identify pre-disaster mitigation needs and post-disaster recovery priorities by predicting the possible outcomes of different plans. Although several recovery models have been proposed, there are still gaps in the understanding of how decisions made by individuals and different entities interact to output the recovery. Additionally, integrating spatial aspects of recovery is a missing key in many models. The current research proposes a spatial model for simulation and prediction of homeowners’ recovery decisions through incorporating recovery drivers that could capture interactions of individual, communal, and organizational decisions. RecovUS is a spatial agent-based model for which all the input data can be obtained from publicly available data sources. The model is presented using the data on the recovery of Staten Island, New York, after Hurricane Sandy in 2012. The results confirm that the combination of internal, interactive, and external drivers of recovery affect households’ decisions and shape the progress of recovery."
Seed Selection Strategies for Information Diffusion in Social Networks: An Agent-Based Model Applied to Rural Zambia,"Beatrice Nöldeke, Etti Winter and Ulrike Grote","Information Diffusion, Social Networks, Agent-Based Modelling, Seeding, Zambia","The successful adoption of innovations depends on the provision of adequate information to farmers. In rural areas of developing countries, farmers usually rely on their social networks as an information source. Hence, policy-makers and program-implementers can benefit from social diffusion processes to effectively disseminate information. This study aims to identify the set of farmers who initially obtain information (‘seeds’) that optimises diffusion through the network. It systematically evaluates different criteria for seed selection, number of seeds, and their interaction effects. An empirical Agent-Based Model adjusted to a case study in rural Zambia was applied to predict diffusion outcomes for varying seed sets ex ante. Simulations revealed that informing farmers with the most connections leads to highest diffusion speed and reach. Also targeting village heads and farmers with high betweenness centrality, who function as bridges connecting different parts of the network, enhances diffusion. An increased number of seeds improves reach, but the marginal effects of additional seeds decline. Interdependencies between seed set size and selection criteria highlight the importance of considering both seed selection criteria and seed set size for optimising seeding strategies to enhance information diffusion."

By trying out different ‘value-scenarios’, stakeholders who are responsible for, or involved in refugee logistics can have insights into the effects of various value choices. The model is visualized and made usable as a platform (interactive website) for decision-makers to understand the trade-offs in policies for government and non-government organizations."
"Gregarious Behavior, Human Colonization and Social Differentiation: An Agent-Based Model","Sebastian Fajardo, Gert Jan Hofstede, Martijn de Vries, Mark Kramer and Andrés Bernal","Human Colonization, Gregarious Behavior, Social Differentiation, Settlement Patterns, Caribbean, Archaeology","Studies of colonization processes in past human societies often use a standard population model in which population is represented as a single quantity. Real populations in these processes, however, are structured with internal classes or stages, and classes are sometimes created based on social differentiation. In this present work, information about the colonization of Old Providence Island was used to create an agent-based model of the colonization process in a heterogeneous environment for a population with social differentiation. Agents were socially divided into two classes and modeled with dissimilar spatial clustering preferences. The model and simulations assessed the importance of gregarious behavior for colonization processes conducted in heterogeneous environments by socially-differentiated populations. Results suggest that in these conditions, the colonization process starts with an agent cluster in the largest and most suitable area. The spatial distribution of agents maintained a tendency toward randomness as simulation time increased, even when gregariousness values increased. The most conspicuous effects in agent clustering were produced by the initial conditions and behavioral adaptations that increased the agent capacity to access more resources and the likelihood of gregariousness. The approach presented here could be used to analyze past human colonization events or support long-term conceptual design of future human colonization processes with small social formations into unfamiliar and uninhabited environments."
Indirect Reciprocity with Contagious Reputation in Large-Scale Small-World Networks,Markus Neumann,"Altruism, Evolution, Network, Simulation, Small-World","The question of why acts of selflessness occur in a Hobbesian self-help world has fascinated scholars for decades, if not centuries. Utilizing simulations, previous research has shown that altruism can be evolutionarily stable in small-scale societies under a narrow set of circumstances. However, when expanding such models to populations of anything larger than a few hundred people, they generally break down. In this paper, I modify the widely used image-score mechanism to include contagion-based reputation and demonstrate how altruism can survive in populations of up to 20,000. I also find that selflessness strongly depends on network topology - as heavily clustered small-world societies that resemble tight-knit family or friendship structures promote more cooperation than random networks where connections are more superficial."
Modeling Cultural Dissemination and Divergence Between Rural and Urban Regions,"Nicholas LaBerge, Aria Chaderjian, Victor Ginelli, Margrethe Jebsen and Adam Landsberg","Cultural Evolution, Cultural Transmission, Opinion Dynamics, Agent-Based Modeling, Cultural Dissemination","The process by which beliefs, opinions, and other individual, socially malleable attributes spread across a society, known as ""cultural dissemination,"" is a broadly recognized concept among sociologists and political scientists. Yet fundamental aspects of how this process can ultimately lead to cultural divergences between rural and urban segments of society are currently poorly understood. This article uses an agent-based model to isolate and analyze one very basic yet essential facet of this issue, namely, the question of how the intrinsic differences in urban and rural population densities influence the levels of cultural homogeneity/heterogeneity that emerge within each region. Because urban and rural cultures do not develop in isolation from one another, the dynamical interplay between the two is of particular import in their evolution. It is found that, in urban areas, the relatively high number of local neighbors with whom one can interact tends to promote cultural homogeneity in both urban and rural regions. Moreover, and rather surprisingly, the higher frequency of potential interactions with neighbors within urban regions promotes homogeneity in urban regions but tends to drive rural regions towards greater levels of heterogeneity."
WorkSim: An Agent-Based Model of Labor Markets,"Jean-Daniel Kant, Gérard Ballot and Olivier Goudet","Agent-Based Simulation, Dual Labor Markets, Anticipations, Bounded Rationality, Policy Evaluation","In this paper, we provide an overview of the WorkSim model, an agent-based framework designed to study labor markets. The first objective of this model was to reproduce, within rigorous stock-flow accounting, the gross flows of individuals between important work-states: i.e., employment (distinguishing fixed term contracts and open-ended contracts), unemployment and inactivity. French legal institutions of the labor market are modelled in some detail and constrain the decisions of the agents on job flows and worker flows. Firms and individuals are heterogeneous and all decisions are taken on the basis of bounded rationality, yet employers as well as workers form imperfect anticipations. One important theoretical novelty of the model is that we consider multi-job firms and shocks on the individual demand of the firms. Employers consider anticipated shocks when they decide on the types of contract. Once the model was calibrated, the secondary objective was to characterize the nature of the labor market under study, and notably the differentiated roles of the two types of contracts and their impact on unemployment. This is achieved, first by examining the patterns of flows and stocks of labor and secondly by sensitivity experiments, modifying certain exogenous parameters and variables such as total demand. We then used the model as a tool for experimenting labor market policies, including changes in the labor law in France."
Model Exploration of an Information-Based Healthcare Intervention Using Parallelization and Active Learning,"Chaitanya Kaligotla, Jonathan Ozik, Nicholson Collier, Charles M. Macal, Kelly Boyd, Jennifer Makelarski, Elbert S. Huang and Stacy T. Lindau","Agent-Based Modeling, Model Exploration, High-Performance Computing, Active Learning","This paper describes the application of a large-scale active learning method to characterize the parameter space of a computational agent-based model developed to investigate the impact of CommunityRx, a clinical information-based health intervention that provides patients with personalized information about local community resources to meet basic and self-care needs. The diffusion of information about community resources and their use is modeled via networked interactions and their subsequent effect on agents' use of community resources across an urban population. A random forest model is iteratively fitted to model evaluations to characterize the model parameter space with respect to observed empirical data. We demonstrate the feasibility of using high-performance computing and active learning model exploration techniques to characterize large parameter spaces; by partitioning the parameter space into potentially viable and non-viable regions, we rule out regions of space where simulation output is implausible to observed empirical data. We argue that such methods are necessary to enable model exploration in complex computational models that incorporate increasingly available micro-level behavior data. We provide public access to the model and high-performance computing experimentation code."
Leveraging Modularity During Replication of High-Fidelity Models: Lessons from Replicating an Agent-Based Model for HIV Prevention,"Wouter Vermeer, Arthur Hjorth, Samuel M. Jenness, C Hendrick Brown and Uri Wilensky","Replication, Agent-Based Models, Modular, High-Fidelity, HIV","High-fidelity models are increasingly used to predict, and guide decision making. Prior work has emphasized the importance of replication in ensuring reliable modeling, and has yielded important replication strategies. However, this work is based on relatively simple theory generating models, and its lessons might not translate to high-fidelity models used for decision support. Using NetLogo we replicate a recently published high-fidelity model examining the effects of a HIV biomedical intervention. We use a modular approach to build our model from the ground up, and provide examples of the replication process investigating the replication of two sub-modules as well as the overall simulation experiment. For the first module, we achieved numerical identity during replication, whereas we obtained distributional equivalence in replicating the second module. We achieved relational equivalence among the overall model behaviors, with a 0.98 correlation across the two implementations for our outcome measure even without strictly following the original model in the formation of the sexual network. Our results show that replication of high-fidelity models is feasible when following a set of systematic strategies that leverage the modularity, and highlight the role of replication standards, modular testing, and functional code in facilitating such strategies."
Housing Market Agent-Based Simulation with Loan-To-Value and Debt-To-Income,Tae-Sub Yun and Il-Chul Moon,"Housing Market, Macro-Prudential Policy, Loan-To-Value, Debt-To-Income, Agent-Based Modeling, Policy Impact Analysis","This paper introduces an agent-based model of a housing market with macro-prudential policy experiments. Specifically, the simulation model is used to examine the effects of a policy setting on loan-to-value (LTV) and debt-to-income (DTI), which are policy instruments several governments use to regulate the housing market. The simulation model illustrates the interactions among the households, the house suppliers, and the real estate brokers. We model each household in the population as either seller or buyer, and some of households may behave as speculators in the housing market. To better understand the impact of the policies, we used the real-world observations from the Korean housing market, which include various economic conditions, policy variables, and Korean census data. Our baseline model is quantitatively validated to the price index and the transaction volume of the past Korean housing market. After validation, we show the empirical effectiveness of setting LTV and DTI towards house prices, transaction volumes, and the amount of households' mortgages. Furthermore, we investigate the simulation results for the owner-occupier rate of households. These investigations provide the policy analyses in Korea's housing market, and other governments with LTV and DTI regulations."
A Weighted Balance Model of Opinion Hyperpolarization,"Simon Schweighofer, Frank Schweitzer and David Garcia","Polarization, Balance Theory, Opinion Dynamics, Agent-Based Modeling","Polarization is threatening the stability of democratic societies. Until now, polarization research has focused on opinion extremeness, overlooking the correlation between different policy issues. In this paper, we explain the emergence of hyperpolarization, i.e., the combination of extremeness and correlation between issues, by developing a new theory of opinion formation called ""Weighted Balance Theory (WBT)"". WBT extends Heider's cognitive balance theory to encompass multiple weighted attitudes. We validated WBT on empirical data from the 2016 National Election Survey. Furthermore, we developed an opinion dynamics model based on WBT, which, for the first time, is able to generate hyperpolarization and to explain the link between affective and opinion polarization. Finally, our theory encompasses other phenomena of opinion dynamics, including mono-polarization and backfire effects."
Simulating Crowds in Real Time with Agent-Based Modelling and a Particle Filter,"Nick Malleson, Kevin Minors, Le-Minh Kieu, Jonathan A. Ward, Andrew West and Alison Heppenstall","Agent-Based Modelling, Particle Filter, Data Assimilation, Crowd Simulation, Pedestrian Modelling","Agent-based modelling is a valuable approach for modelling systems whose behaviour is driven by the interactions between distinct entities, such as crowds of people. However, it faces a fundamental difficulty: there are no established mechanisms for dynamically incorporating real-time data into models. This limits simulations that are inherently dynamic, such as those of pedestrian movements, to scenario testing on historic patterns rather than real-time simulation of the present. This paper demonstrates how a particle filter could be used to incorporate data into an agent-based model of pedestrian movements at run time. The experiments show that although it is possible to use a particle filter to perform online (real time) model optimisation, the number of individual particles required (and hence the computational complexity) increases exponentially with the number of agents. Furthermore, the paper assumes a one-to-one mapping between observations and individual agents, which would not be the case in reality. Therefore this paper lays some of the fundamental groundwork and highlights the key challenges that need to be addressed for the real-time simulation of crowd movements to become a reality. Such success could have implications for the management of complex environments both nationally and internationally such as transportation hubs, hospitals, shopping centres, etc."
Problem Solving: When Groups Perform Better Than Teammates,"Timoteo Carletti, Alessio Guarino, Andrea Guazzini and Federica Stefanelli","Collective Intelligence, Problem Solving, Emergent Behaviour","People tend to form groups when they have to solve difficult problems because  groups seem to have better problem-solving capabilities than individuals. Indeed, during their evolution, human beings learned that cooperation is frequently an optimal strategy to solve hard problems both quickly and accurately. The ability of a group to determine a solution to a given problem, once group members alone cannot, has been called ""Collective Intelligence"". Such emergent property of the group as a whole is the result of a complex interaction between many factors. Here, we propose a simple and analytically solvable model disentangling the direct link between collective intelligence and the average intelligence of group members. We found that there is a non-linear relation between the collective intelligence of a group and the average intelligence quotient of its members depending on task difficulty. We found three regimes as follows: for simple tasks, the level of collective intelligence of a group is a decreasing function of teammates' intelligence quotient; when tasks have intermediate difficulties, the relation between collective intelligence and intelligence quotient shows a non-monotone behaviour; for complex tasks, the level of collective intelligence of a group monotonically increases with teammates' intelligence quotient with phase transitions emerging when varying the latter's level. Although simple and abstract, our model paves the way for future experimental explorations of the link between task complexity, individual intelligence and group performance."
Reflexivity in a Diffusion of Innovations Model,Carlos Córdoba and César García-Díaz,"Reflexivity, Diffusion of Innovations, Second-Order Emergence, Global Network Externalities","Reflexive phenomena are usually understood in the social sciences as processes that affect themselves recursively. This stems from the mutual altering relationship between participants and the social process they belong to: participants can change the course of the process with their actions and a new state during the evolution of the process can lead to a change in its participants' behavior. This article proposes an agent-based model of diffusion of innovations in a social network to study reflexivity. In this model, agents decide to adopt a new product according to a utility function that depends on two kinds of social influences. First, there is a local influence exerted on an agent by her closest neighbors that have already adopted, and also by herself if she feels the product suits her personal needs. Second, there is a global influence which leads agents to adopt when they become aware of emerging trends happening in the system. For this, we endow agents with a reflexive capacity that allows them to recognize a trend, even if they can not perceive a significant change in their neighborhood. Results reveal the appearance of slowdown periods along the adoption rate curve, in contrast with the classic stylized bell-shaped behavior. Results also show that network structure plays an important role in the effect of reflexivity: while some structures (e.g., scale-free networks) may amplify it, others (e.g., small-world structure) weaken such an effect. The contribution of this work lies in the inclusion of evolving cognitive distinctions as agents decide product adoption in diffusion processes."
A Simulation Model of the Radicalisation Process Based on the IVEE Theoretical Framework,"Rosemary Pepys, Robert Bowles and Noémie Bouhana","Radicalisation, Social-Ecological Modelling, State-Transition Modelling, Model Development, Stylized Facts","This paper presents a simulation model describing the radicalisation process. The radicalisation process is a complex human socio-environmental process which has been of much academic interest for the past two decades. Despite this it is still poorly understood and is an extremely difficult area for social scientists to research. It is a subject which suffers from a lack of available data, making the construction of an effective simulation model particularly challenging. In order to construct the simulation in this paper we rely on a theoretical framework which was originally developed as a means of synthesising the academic literature on radicalisation. This theoretical framework has three levels: individual vulnerability to radicalisation, exposure to radicalising moral contexts, and the emergence of radicalising settings. We adapt this framework into a simulation model by first re-constructing it as an individual-level state-transition model. Next, appropriate data is sought to parameterise the model. A parallel is drawn between the process of radicalisation and the process by which people develop the propensity to participate in more general acts of criminality; this analogy enables considerably more data to be used in parameterisation. The model is then calibrated by considering the logical differences between crime and terrorism which might lead to differences in the radicalisation and criminality development processes. The model is validated against stylised facts, demonstrating that despite being highly theoretical the simulation is capable of producing a realistic output. Possible uses of the model to evaluate the effectiveness of counter-radicalisation measures are also considered."
An Agent-Based Approach to Integrated Assessment Modelling of Climate Change,"Marcin Czupryna, Christian Franzke, Sascha Hokamp and Jürgen Scheffran","Climate Change, Climate Protection, Integrated Assessment Model, Agent-Based Modelling","There is an ongoing discussion concerning the relationship between social welfare and climate change, and thus the required level and type of measures needed to protect the climate. Integrated assessment models (IAMs) have been extended to incorporate technological progress, heterogeneity and uncertainty, making use of a (stochastic) dynamic equilibrium approach in order to derive a solution. According to the literature, the IAM class of models does not take all the relationships among economic, social and environmental factors into account. Moreover, it does not consider these interdependencies at the micro-level, meaning that all possible consequences are not duly examined. Here, we propose an agent-based approach to analyse the relationship between economic welfare and climate protection. In particular, our aim is to analyse how the decisions of individual agents, allowing for the trade-off between economic welfare and climate protection, influence the aggregated emergent economic behaviour. Using this model, we estimate a damage function, with values in the order 3% - 4%for 2 C temperature increase and having a linear (or slightly concave) shape. We show that the heterogeneity of the agents, technological progress and the damage function may lead to lower GDP growth rates and greater temperature-related damage than what is forecast by models with solely homogeneous (representative) agents."

Purshouse","Agent-Based Modelling, Social Simulation, Software Architecture, Analytical Sociology, Abductive Reasoning","This paper introduces the MBSSM (Mechanism-Based Social Systems Modelling) software architecture that is designed for expressing mechanisms of social theories with individual behaviour components in a unified way and implementing these mechanisms in an agent-based simulation model. The MBSSM architecture is based on a middle-range theory approach most recently expounded by analytical sociology and is designed in the object-oriented programming paradigm with Unified Modelling Language diagrams. This paper presents two worked examples of using the architecture for modelling individual behaviour mechanisms that give rise to the dynamics of population-level alcohol use: a single-theory model of norm theory and a multi-theory model that combines norm theory with role theory. The MBSSM architecture provides a computational environment within which theories based on social mechanisms can be represented, compared, and integrated. The architecture plays a fundamental enabling role within a wider simulation model-based framework of abductive reasoning in which families of theories are tested for their ability to explain concrete social phenomena."
Price Formation in Parallel Trading Systems: Evidence from the Fine Wine Market,"Marcin Czupryna, Michał Jakubczyk and Paweł Oleksy","Parallel Trading, Trading Systems, Price Formation, Wine Investment, Agent Based Modelling","What drives the prices of fine wines is not easy to discern, in view of a multitude of confounding factors characterising the transactions across several markets. At the same time, understanding the quantitative relationships and mechanisms that determine the price level is important for policy making (e.g. predicting the outcomes of regulations) and methodological purposes (which elements to consider in modelling these markets). We examine the price formation of fine wines simultaneously across three markets: an automated electronic exchange (Liv-ex), intermediated auctions, and over-the-counter (OTC). We use a unique dataset consisting of 99,769 price data points for Premier Cru Bordeaux fine wines and we examine the price determinants with Bayesian modelling. We ascertain the mean price ranking (OTC market being the most expensive and Liv-ex the least, differing by about 4.5% and -0.8% from the auctions). We also find a slight price decrease for larger transactions (approx.~0.3% reduction for a 10% volume increase) and some platykurtosis in price distribution (greatest in Liv-ex), and observe the most stochastic noise in auctions. In an agent-based simulation, we discover that it is necessary to include trading mechanisms, commissions, and OTC market heterogeneity to reproduce the observed characteristics. Our results indicate which elements should be included in future fine wine markets models."
Comparing Actual and Simulated HFT Traders' Behavior for Agent Design,"Masanori Hirano, Kiyoshi Izumi, Hiroyasu Matsushima and Hiroki Sakaji","Artificial Market, Multi-Agent Simulation, Data-Mining, High-Frequency Trade, Market-Making, Clustering","Recently financial markets have shown significant risks and levels of volatility. Understanding the sources of these risks require simulation models capable of representing adequately the real mechanisms of markets. In this paper, we compared data of the high-frequency-trader market-making (HFT-MM) strategy from both the real financial market and our simulation. Regarding the former, we extracted trader clusters and identified one cluster whose statistical indexes indicated HFT-MM features. We then analyzed the difference between these traders' orders and the market price. In our simulation, we built an artificial market model with a continuous double auction system, stylized trader agents, and HFT-MM trader agents based on prior research. As an experiment, we compared the distribution of the order placements of HFT-MM traders in the real and simulated financial data. We found that the order placement distribution near the market or best price in both the real data and the simulations were similar. However, the orders far from the market or best price differed significantly when the real data exhibited a wider range of orders. This indicates that in order to build more realistic simulation of financial markets, integrating fine-grained data is essential."
Impacts of Consensus Protocols and Trade Network Topologies on Blockchain System Performance,"Xianhua Wei, Aiya Li and Zhou He","Blockchain, Consensus Protocol, Trade Network Topology, Agent-Based Model","Blockchain can be viewed as a public ledger maintained collectively by a large number of participators based on consensus protocol. We are interested in how difference consensus protocols and trade network topologies affect the performance of a blockchain system, which has not been studied in the literature yet. In this paper, we proposed an agent-based model consisting of multiple trader and miner agents, and one system agent. We investigated three consensus protocols, namely proof-of-work (PoW), proof-of-stake (PoS), and delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS). We also examined three common trade network topologies: random, small-world, and scale-free. We find that both consensus protocol and trade network topology can impact the performance of blockchain system. PoS and DPoS are generally better than PoW in terms of increasing trade efficiency and equalizing wealth. Besides, scale-free trade network is not favorable because its trade efficiency is quite low, which moderates the price fluctuation and wealth inequality. Since connectivity inequality determines wealth inequality, it is crucial to increase the connectivity among participants when designing a sustainable blockchain system. We suggest that our findings could be useful to the designers, practitioner and researchers of blockchain system and token economy."
Grade Language Heterogeneity in Simulation Models of Peer Review,"Thomas Feliciani, Ramanathan Moorthy, Pablo Lucas and Kalpana Shankar","Peer Review, Grade Language, Agent-Based Modeling","Simulation models have proven to be valuable tools for studying peer review processes. However, the effects of some of these models’ assumptions have not been tested, nor have these models been examined in comparative contexts. In this paper, we address two of these assumptions which go in tandem: (1) on the granularity of the evaluation scale, and (2) on the homogeneity of the grade language (i.e. whether reviewers interpret evaluation grades in the same fashion). We test the consequences of these assumptions by extending a well-known agent-based model of author and reviewer behaviour with discrete evaluation scales and reviewers’ interpretation of the grade language. In this way, we compare a peer review model with a homogeneous grade language, as assumed in most models of peer review, with a more psychologically realistic model where reviewers interpret the grades of the evaluation scale heterogeneously. We find that grade language heterogeneity can indeed affect the predictions of a model of peer review."

The pandemic is also posing severe challenges to the scientific community, with scholars under pressure to respond to policymakers’ demands for advice despite the absence of adequate, trusted data. Understanding the pandemic requires fine-grained data representing specific local conditions and the social reactions of individuals. While experts have built simulation models to estimate disease trajectories that may be enough to guide decision-makers to formulate policy measures to limit the epidemic, they do not cover the full behavioural and social complexity of societies under pandemic crisis. Modelling that has such a large potential impact upon people’s lives is a great responsibility. This paper calls on the scientific community to improve the transparency, access, and rigour of their models. It also calls on stakeholders to improve the rapidity with which data from trusted sources are released to the community (in a fully responsible manner).  Responding to the pandemic is a stress test of our collaborative capacity and the social/economic value of research."

As a standardized document for providing a consistent, logical and readable account of the structure and dynamics of ABMs, some research groups also find it useful as a workflow for model design. Even so, there are still limitations to ODD that obstruct its more widespread adoption. Such limitations are discussed and addressed in this paper: the limited availability of guidance on how to use ODD; the length of ODD documents; limitations of ODD for highly complex models; lack of sufficient details of many ODDs to enable reimplementation without access to the model code; and the lack of provision for sections in the document structure covering model design rationale, the model’s underlying narrative, and the means by which the model’s fitness for purpose is evaluated. We document the steps we have taken to provide better guidance on: structuring complex ODDs and an ODD summary for inclusion in a journal article (with full details in supplementary material; Table 1); using ODD to point readers to relevant sections of the model code; update the document structure to include sections on model rationale and evaluation. We also further advocate the need for standard descriptions of simulation experiments and argue that ODD can in principle be used for any type of simulation model. Thereby ODD would provide a lingua franca for simulation modelling."
A Dynamic Computational Model of Social Stigma,Myong-Hun Chang and Joseph Harrington,"Stigma, Diffusion, Conformity, Compassion, Social Network","The dynamics of social stigma are explored in the context of diffusion models. Our focus is on exploring the dynamic process through which the behavior of individuals and the interpersonal relationships among them influence the macro-social attitude towards the stigma. We find that a norm of tolerance is best promoted when the population comprises both those whose conduct is driven by compassion for the stigmatized and those whose focus is on conforming with others in their social networks. A second finding is that less insular social networks encourage de-stigmatization when most people are compassionate, but it is instead more insularity that promotes tolerance when society is dominated by conformity."
Homophily as a Process Generating Social Networks: Insights from Social Distance Attachment Model,Szymon Talaga and Andrzej Nowak,"Social Networks, Homophily, Social Distance Attachment, Configuration Model","Real-world social networks often exhibit high levels of clustering, positive degree assortativity, short average path lengths (small-world property) and right-skewed but rarely power law degree distributions. On the other hand homophily, defined as the propensity of similar agents to connect to each other, is one of the most fundamental social processes observed in many human and animal societies. In this paper we examine the extent to which homophily is sufficient to produce the typical structural properties of social networks. To do so, we conduct a simulation study based on the Social Distance Attachment (SDA) model, a particular kind of Random Geometric Graph (RGG), in which nodes are embedded in a social space and connection probabilities depend functionally on distances between nodes. We derive the form of the model from first principles based on existing analytical results and argue that the mathematical construction of RGGs corresponds directly to the homophily principle, so they provide a good model for it. We find that homophily, especially when combined with a random edge rewiring, is sufficient to reproduce many of the characteristic features of social networks. Additionally, we devise a hybrid model combining SDA with the configuration model that allows generating homophilic networks with arbitrary degree sequences and we use it to study interactions of homophily with processes imposing constraints on degree distributions. We show that the effects of homophily on clustering are robust with respect to distribution constraints, while degree assortativity can be highly dependent on the particular kind of enforced degree sequence."

To this end we put forward a computational multi-agent model where agents of overlapping generations interact in a dynamically evolving social network. In the model, four distinct dimensions of individuals’ social capital: degree, centrality, heterophilous and homophilous interactions, determine their generalized trust and willingness to cooperate, altogether helping them achieve certain levels of social utility (i.e., utility from social contacts) and economic performance. We find that the stationary state of the simulated social network exhibits realistic small-world topology. We also observe that societies whose social networks are relatively frequently reconfigured, display relatively higher generalized trust, willingness to cooperate, and economic performance – at the cost of lower social utility. Similar outcomes are found for societies where social tie dissolution is relatively weakly linked to family closeness."

Mertens, Markus Richter, Cédric Scherer, Kirana Widyastuti, Marie-Christin Wimmler, Liubov Zakharova and Uta Berger","Individual-Based Model, Surrogate Model, Emulator, Calibration, Sensitivity Analysis, Review","The recent advancement of agent-based modeling is characterized by higher demands on the parameterization, evaluation and documentation of these computationally expensive models. Accordingly, there is also a growing request for ""easy to go"" applications just mimicking the input-output behavior of such models. Metamodels are being increasingly used for these tasks. In this paper, we provide an overview of common metamodel types and the purposes of their usage in an agent-based modeling context. To guide modelers in the selection and application of metamodels for their own needs, we further assessed their implementation effort and performance. We performed a literature research in January 2019 using four different databases. Five different terms paraphrasing metamodels (approximation, emulator, meta-model, metamodel and surrogate) were used to capture the whole range of relevant literature in all disciplines. All metamodel applications found were then categorized into specific metamodel types and rated by different junior and senior researches from varying disciplines (including forest sciences, landscape ecology, or economics) regarding the implementation effort and performance. Specifically, we captured the metamodel performance according to (i) the consideration of uncertainties, (ii) the suitability assessment provided by the authors for the particular purpose, and (iii) the number of valuation criteria provided for suitability assessment. We selected 40 distinct metamodel applications from studies published in peer-reviewed journals from 2005 to 2019. These were used for the sensitivity analysis, calibration and upscaling of agent-based models, as well to mimic their prediction for different scenarios. This review provides information about the most applicable metamodel types for each purpose and forms a first guidance for the implementation and validation of metamodels for agent-based models."
Phase Transition in the Social Impact Model of Opinion Formation in Scale-Free Networks: The Social Power Effect,Alireza Mansouri and Fattaneh Taghiyareh,"Opinion Formation, Noise, Agent-Based Modeling, Social Impact Model, Phase Transition","Human interactions and opinion exchanges lead to social opinion dynamics, which is well described by opinion formation models. In these models, a random parameter is usually considered as the system noise, indicating the individual's inexplicable opinion changes. This noise could be an indicator of any other influential factors, such as public media, affects, and emotions. We study phase transitions, changes from one social phase to another, for various noise levels in a discrete opinion formation model based on the social impact theory with a scale-free random network as its interaction network topology. We also generate another similar model using the concept of social power based on the agents' node degrees in the interaction network as an estimation for their persuasiveness and supportiveness strengths and compare both models from phase transition viewpoint. We show by agent-based simulation and analytical considerations how opinion phases, including majority and non-majority, are formed in terms of the initial population of agents in opinion groups and noise levels. Two factors affect the system phase in equilibrium when the noise level increases: breaking up more segregated groups and dominance of stochastic behavior of the agents on their deterministic behavior. In the high enough noise levels, the system reaches a non-majority phase in equilibrium, regardless of the initial combination of opinion groups. In relatively low noise levels, the original model and the model whose agents' strengths are proportional to their centrality have different behaviors. The presence of a few high-connected influential leaders in the latter model consequences a different behavior in reaching equilibrium phase and different thresholds of noise levels for phase transitions."
Do Farm Characteristics or Social Dynamics Explain the Conversion to Organic Farming by Dairy Farmers? An Agent-Based Model of Dairy Farming in 27 French Cantons,"Qing Xu, Sylvie Huet, Eric Perret and Guillaume Deffuant","Organic Farming, Adaptation, Theory of Reasoned Action, Agent-Based Model, Social Influence, Credibility","The drivers of conversion to organic farming, which is still a residual choice in agriculture, are poorly understood. Many scholars argue that farm characteristics can determine this choice but do not exclude the role of social dynamics. To study this issue, we developed an agent-based model in which agents' decisions to shift to organic farming are based on a comparison between satisfaction with the current situation and potential satisfaction with an alternative farming strategy. A farmer agent’s satisfaction is modelled using the Theory of Reasoned Action. This makes it necessary to compare an agent's productions over time with those of other agents to whom the former attributes considerable credibility (“important others”). Moreover, farmers make technical changes that affect their productions by imitating other credible farmers. While we first used this model to examine simple and abstract farm populations, here we also adapted it for use with data from an Agricultural Census concerning the farm characteristics of dairy farming in 27 French “cantons”. Based on domain expertise, data and previous research, we propose certain laws for modelling the impact of conversion on the farm production of milk and the  environment. The simulations with “real” populations of farms confirm the important impact of farm characteristics. However, our results also suggest a complex impact of social dynamics that can favour or impede the diffusion of organic farming through dynamic implicit networks of similarity and credibility. We confirm the great importance of demographic changes in farm characteristics."
Tension Between Stability and Representativeness in a Democratic Setting,"Victorien Barbet, Juliette Rouchier, Noé Guiraud and Vincent Laperrière","Agent-Based Model, Communication, Opinion Dynamics, Democracy, Non-Profit Organization, Short Food Chain","We present a model showing the evolution of an organization of agents who discuss democratically about good practices. This model feeds on a field study we did for about twelve years in France where we followed NPOs, called AMAP, and observed their construction through time at the regional and national level. Most of the hypothesis we make are here either based on the literature on opinion diffusion or on the results of our field study. By defining dynamics where agents influence each other, make collective decision at the group level, and decide to stay in or leave their respective groups, we analyse the effect of different forms of vertical communication that is meant to spread good practices within the organization. Our main indicators of the good functioning of the democratic dynamics are stability and representativeness. We show that if communication about norms is well designed, it has a positive impact on both stability and representativeness. Interestingly the effect of communication increases with the number of dimensions discussed in the groups. Communication about norms is thus a valuable tool to use in groups that wish to improve their democratic practices without jeopardizing stability."
Estimating Spatio-Temporal Risks from Volcanic Eruptions Using an Agent-Based Model,"J Jumadi, Nick Malleson, Steve Carver and Duncan Quincey","ABM, Volcanic Crisis, Risk Estimation, Spatio-Temporal Modeling, MCE, Merapi","Managing disasters caused by natural events, especially volcanic crises, requires a range of approaches, including risk modelling and analysis. Risk modelling is commonly conducted at the community/regional scale using GIS. However, people and objects move in response to a crisis, so static approaches cannot capture the dynamics of the risk properly, as they do not accommodate objects’ movements within time and space. The emergence of Agent-Based Modelling makes it possible to model the risk at an individual level as it evolves over space and time. We propose a new approach of Spatio-Temporal Dynamics Model of Risk (STDMR) by integrating multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) within a georeferenced agent-based model, using Mt. Merapi, Indonesia, as a case study. The model makes it possible to simulate the spatio-temporal dynamics of those at risk during a volcanic crisis. Importantly, individual vulnerability is heterogeneous and depends on the characteristics of the individuals concerned. The risk for the individuals is dynamic and changes along with the hazard and their location. The model is able to highlight a small number of high-risk spatio-temporal positions where, due to the behaviour of individuals who are evacuating the volcano and the dynamics of the hazard itself, the overall risk in those times and places is extremely high. These outcomes are extremely relevant for the stakeholders, and the work of coupling an ABM, MCE, and dynamic volcanic hazard is both novel and contextually relevant."
Catch Me if You Can:  Using a Threshold Model to Simulate Support for Presidential Candidates in the Invisible Primary,"Elizabeth A. Stiles, Colin D. Swearingen, Linda Seiter and Brendan Foreman","Social Network Analysis, Threshold Model, Invisible Primary, Campaigns, Elections, Presidency","The invisible primary is an important time in United States Presidential primary politics as candidates gain momentum for their campaigns before they compete formally in the first state caucus (Iowa) and primaries (e.g. New Hampshire). However, this critical period has not been possible to observe, hence the name.  By simulating networks of primary followers, we can explicate hypotheses for how messages travel through networks to affect voter preferences. To do so, we use a threshold model to drive our simulated network analysis testing spread of public support for candidates in invisible primaries. We assign voter thresholds for candidates and vary number of voters, attachment to candidates and decay. We also vary social graph structure and model. Results of the algorithm show effects of size of lead, an unwavering base of support, and information loss."
Calibrating Agent-Based Models with Linear Regressions,"Ernesto Carrella, Richard Bailey and Jens Madsen","Agent-Based Models, Indirect Inference, Estimation, Calibration, Simulated Minimum Distance, Approximate Bayesian Computation","In this paper, we introduce a simple way to parametrize simulation models by using regularized linear regression. Regressions bypass the three major challenges of calibrating by minimization: selecting the summary statistics, defining the distance function and minimizing it numerically. By substituting regression with classification, we can extend this approach to model selection. We present five example estimations: a statistical fit, a biological individual-based model, a simple real business cycle model, a non-linear biological simulation and heuristics selection in a fishery agent-based model. The outcome is a method that automatically chooses summary statistics, weighs them and uses them to parametrize models without running any direct minimization."
LevelSpace: A NetLogo Extension for Multi-Level Agent-Based Modeling,"Arthur Hjorth, Bryan Head, Corey Brady and Uri Wilensky","Multi-Level, Agent-Based Modeling, Modeling Tools, Netlogo","Multi-Level Agent-Based Modeling (ML-ABM) has been receiving increasing attention in recent years. In this paper we present LevelSpace, an extension that allows modelers to easily build ML-ABMs in the popular and widely used NetLogo language. We present the LevelSpace framework and its associated programming primitives. Based on three common use-cases of ML-ABM – coupling of heterogenous models, dynamic adaptation of detail, and cross-level interaction - we show how easy it is to build ML-ABMs with LevelSpace. We argue that it is important to have a unified conceptual language for describing LevelSpace models, and present six dimensions along which models can differ, and discuss how these can be combined into a variety of ML-ABM types in LevelSpace. Finally, we argue that future work should explore the relationships between these six dimensions, and how different configurations of them might be more or less appropriate for particular modeling tasks."
An Agent-Based Model of Firm Size Distribution and Collaborative Innovation,Inyoung Hwang,"Agent-Based Modelling, Prisoner’s Dilemma, Pavlovian Cooperation, Collaborative Innovation, Firm Size Distribution, ICT Industry","ICT-based Collaborative innovation has a significant impact on the economy by facilitating technological convergence and promoting innovation in other industries. However, research on innovation suggests that polarization in firm size distribution, which has grown since the early 2000s, can interfere with collaborative innovation among firms. In this paper, I modelled firms’ decision-making processes that led to collaborative innovation as a spatial N-person iterated Prisoner’s dilemma (NIPD) game using collaborative innovation data from Korean ICT firms. Using an agent-based model, I experimented with the effects of firm size heterogeneity on collaborative innovation. The simulation experiment results reveal that collaborative innovation in the industry increases as the size heterogeneity decreases. Findings suggest that policies promoting collaborative innovation should focus on mitigating structural inequalities in the industry."
An Innovative Approach to Multi-Method Integrated Assessment Modelling of Global Climate Change,"Peer-Olaf Siebers, Zhi En Lim, Grazziela P. Figueredo and James Hey","Integrated Assessment Modelling, Climate Change, Agent-Based Modelling, System Dynamics Modelling, Methodological Advance, Hybridisation, Scalability","Modelling and simulation play an increasingly significant role in exploratory studies for informing policy makers on climate change mitigation strategies. There is considerable research being done in creating Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), which focus on examining the human impacts on climate change. Many popular IAMs are created as steady state optimisation models. They typically employ a nested structure of neoclassical production functions to represent the energy-economy system, holding aggregate views on variables, and hence are unable to capture a finer level of details of the underlying system components. An alternative approach that allows modelling populations as a collection of individual and unevenly distributed entities is Agent-Based Modelling, often used in the field of Social Simulation. But simulating huge numbers of individual entities can quickly become an issue, as it requires large amounts of computational resources. The goal of this paper is to introduce a conceptual framework for developing hybrid IAMs. This novel modelling approach allows us to reuse existing rigid, but well-established IAMs, and adds more flexibility by replacing aggregate stocks with a community of vibrant interacting entities. We provide a proof-of-concept of the application of this conceptual framework in form of an illustrative example. Our test case takes the settings of the US. It is solely created for the purpose of demonstrating our hybrid modelling approach; we do not claim that it has predictive powers."

Methodological Issues of Spatial Agent-Based Models,"Steven Manson, Li An, Keith C. Clarke, Alison Heppenstall, Jennifer Koch, Brittany Krzyzanowski, Fraser Morgan, David O'Sullivan, Bryan C Runck, Eric Shook and Leigh Tesfatsion","Spatial, Agent-Based Model, Methods, Human-Environment Systems","Agent based modeling (ABM) is a standard tool that is useful across many disciplines. Despite widespread and mounting interest in ABM, even broader adoption has been hindered by a set of methodological challenges that run from issues around basic tools to the need for a more complete conceptual foundation for the approach. After several decades of progress, ABMs remain difficult to develop and use for many students, scholars, and policy makers. This difficulty holds especially true for models designed to represent spatial patterns and processes across a broad range of human, natural, and human-environment systems. In this paper, we describe the methodological challenges facing further development and use of spatial ABM (SABM) and suggest some  potential solutions from multiple disciplines. We first define SABM to narrow our object of inquiry, and then explore how spatiality is a source of both advantages and challenges. We examine how time interacts with space in models and delve into issues of model development in general and modeling frameworks and tools specifically. We draw on lessons and insights from fields with a history of ABM contributions, including economics, ecology, geography, ecology, anthropology, and spatial science with the goal of identifying promising ways forward for this powerful means of modeling."
Theory Development Via Replicated Simulations and the Added Value of Standards,"Jonas Hauke, Sebastian Achter and Matthias Meyer","Replication, ABM, ODD, Design of Experiments (DOE), Organizational Routines, Dynamic Capabilities","Using the agent-based model of Miller et al. (2012), which depicts how different types of individuals’ memory affect the formation and performance of organizational routines, we show how a replicated simulation model can be used to develop theory. We also assess how standards, such as the ODD (Overview, Design concepts, and Details) protocol and DOE (design of experiments) principles, support the replication, evaluation, and further analysis of this model. Using the verified model, we conduct several simulation experiments as examples of different types of theory development. First, we show how previous theoretical insights can be generalized by investigating additional scenarios, such as mergers. Second, we show the potential of replicated simulation models for theory refinement, such as analyzing in-depth the relationship between memory functions and routine performance or routine adaptation."
Agent-Based Land Change Modeling of a Large Watershed: Space-Time Locations of Critical Threshold,Wenwu Tang and Jianxin Yang,"Agent-Based Model, Land Use and Land Cover Change, Critical Threshold, Water Quality, North Carolina","Land use and land cover change has been recognized to have significant environmental impacts in a watershed, such as regulation of water quality. However, the identification of potential regions that are sensitive to land change activities for the protection of water quality poses a grand challenge particularly in a large watershed. These potential regions are often associated with critical thresholds in terms of, for example, water quality. In this study, we developed an agent-based land change model to investigate the relationship between land development activities and water quality in eight North Carolina counties that cover the lower High Rock Lake Watershed area. This agent-based model, which is empirically calibrated, is used to identify space-time locations of those regions at critical thresholds of water quality in this study area. Our experimental results suggest that land development as a form of system stress is of pivotal importance in affecting water quality at sub watershed level and the state transition of water quality. The agent-based model developed in this study provides solid support for investigations on the impact of land development under alternative scenarios in a large watershed."
Cascading Impacts of Payments for Ecosystem Services in Complex Human-Environment Systems,"Li An, Judy Mak, Shuang Yang, Rebecca Lewison, Douglas A.

In addition, PES literature is short of ecological metrics that document the consequences of PES other than land use and land cover and its change. Building on detailed survey data from Fanjingshan National Nature Reserve (FNNR), China, we developed and tested an agent-based model to study the complex interactions among human livelihoods (migration and resource extraction in particular), PES, and the Guizhou golden monkey habitat occupancy over 20 years. We then performed simulation-based experiments testing social and ecological impacts of PES payments as well as human population pressures. The results show that with a steady increase in outmigration, the number of land parcels enrolled in one of China’s major PES programs tends to increase, reach a peak, and then slowly decline, showing a convex trend that converges to a stable number of enrolled parcels regardless of payment levels. Simulated monkey occupancy responds to changes in PES payment levels substantially in edge areas of FNNR. Our model is not only useful for FNNR, but also applicable as a platform to study and further understand human and ecological roles of PES in many other complex human-environment systems, shedding light into key elements, interactions, or relationships in the systems that PES researchers and practitioners should bear in mind. Our research contributes to establishing a scientific basis of PES science that incorporates features in complex systems, offering more realistic, spatially and temporally explicit insights related to PES policy or related interventions."
‘One Size Does Not Fit All’: A Roadmap of Purpose-Driven Mixed-Method Pathways for Sensitivity Analysis of Agent-Based Models,"Arika Ligmann-Zielinska, Peer-Olaf Siebers, Nicholas Magliocca, Dawn C. Parker, Volker Grimm, Jing Du, Martin Cenek, Viktoriia Radchuk, Nazia N. Arbab, Sheng Li, Uta Berger, Rajiv Paudel, Derek T. Robinson, Piotr Jankowski, Li An and Xinyue Ye","Sensitivity Analysis, Agent-Based Model, Individual-Based Model, Review","Designing, implementing, and applying agent-based models (ABMs) requires a structured approach, part of which is a comprehensive analysis of the output to input variability in the form of uncertainty and sensitivity analysis (SA). The objective of this paper is to assist in choosing, for a given ABM, the most appropriate methods of SA. We argue that no single SA method fits all ABMs and that different methods of SA should be used based on the overarching purpose of the model. For example, abstract exploratory models that focus on a deeper understanding of the target system and its properties are fed with only the most critical data representing patterns or stylized facts. For them, simple SA methods may be sufficient in capturing the dependencies between the output-input spaces. In contrast, applied models used in scenario and policy-analysis are usually more complex and data-rich because a higher level of realism is required. Here the choice of a more sophisticated SA may be critical in establishing the robustness of the results before the model (or its results) can be passed on to end-users. Accordingly, we present a roadmap that guides ABM developers through the process of performing SA that best fits the purpose of their ABM. This roadmap covers a wide range of ABM applications and advocates for the routine use of global methods that capture input interactions and are, therefore, mandatory if scientists want to recognize all sensitivities. As part of this roadmap, we report on frontier SA methods emerging in recent years: a) handling temporal and spatial outputs, b) using the whole output distribution of a result rather than its variance, c) looking at topological relationships between input data points rather than their values, and d) looking into the ABM black box – finding behavioral primitives and using them to study complex system characteristics like regime shifts, tipping points, and condensation versus dissipation of collective system behavior."
Relational Integration in Schools Through Seating Assignments,Márta Radó and Károly Takács,"Deskmates, Academic Performance, Intervention, Social Networks, Prejudice, Acting White","Traditional desegregation policies have improved but not fully solved the problems associated with the reproduction of inequalities and interracial prejudice in schools. This is partly because social networks are inherently segregated within integrated schools and the benefits of contact have not fully materialized. Therefore, new kinds of policies are needed to further improve the situation. This paper investigates the consequences and efficiency of seating arrangements on academic outcomes and prejudice using an agent-based model that reflects real-life asymmetries. We model interpersonal dynamics and study behavior in the classroom in the hypothetical case of a single teacher who defines students’ seating arrangements. The model incorporates the mechanisms of peer influence on study behavior, on attitude formation, and homophilous selection in order to depict the interrelated dynamics of networks, behavior, and attitudes. We compare various seating arrangement scenarios and observe how GPA distribution and level of prejudice changes over time. Results highlight the advantages and disadvantages of seating strategies. In general, more heterogeneous deskmate pairs lead to a lower level of inequality and prejudice in the classroom, but this strategy does not favor talent management. Further, we evaluate outcomes compared to the absence of external intervention whereby students choose their own deskmates based on homophilous selection. Our model takes into account the fact that homophilous selection may be distorted due to the ‘Acting White’ phenomenon and pre-existing prejudice. Accounting for these factors implies slower convergence between advantaged and disadvantaged students."
An Agent-Based Model to Simulate Meat Consumption Behaviour of Consumers in Britain,"Andrea Scalco, Jennie I. Macdiarmid, Tony Craig, Stephen Whybrow and Graham. W. Horgan","Consumer Behaviour, Food Choice, Meat Consumption, Population Health, Social Influence","The current rate of production and consumption of meat poses a problem both to peoples’ health and to the environment. This work aims to develop a simulation of peoples’ meat consumption in Britain using agent-based modelling. The agents represent individual consumers. The key variables that characterise agents include sex, age, monthly income, perception of the living cost, and concerns about the impact of meat on the environment, health, and animal welfare. A process of peer influence is modelled with respect to the agents’ concerns. Influence spreads across two eating networks (i.e. co-workers and household members) depending on the time of day, day of the week, and agents’ employment status. Data from a representative sample of British consumers is used to empirically ground the model. Different experiments are run simulating interventions of the application of social marketing campaigns and a rise in price of meat. The main outcome is the mean weekly consumption of meat per consumer. A secondary outcome is the likelihood of eating meat. Analyses are run on the overall artificial population and by subgroups. The model succeeded in reproducing observed consumption patterns. Different sizes of effect on consumption emerged depending on the application of a social marketing strategy or a price increase. A price increase had a greater effect than environmental and animal welfare campaigns, while a health campaign had a larger impact on consumers’ behaviour than the other campaigns. An environmental campaign targeted at consumers concerned about the environment produced a boomerang effect increasing the consumption in the population rather than reducing it. The results of the simulation experiments are mainly consistent with the literature on food consumption providing support for future models of public strategies to reduce meat consumption."
Agent-Based Modelling of Charging Behaviour of Electric Vehicle Drivers,"Mart van der Kam, Annemijn Peters, Wilfried van Sark and Floor Alkemade","Electric Vehicles, Intermittent Renewables, Smart Charging, Environmental Self-Identity, Range Anxiety, Agent-Based Model","The combination of electric vehicles (EVs) and intermittent renewable energy sources has received increasing attention over the last few years. Not only does charging electric vehicles with renewable energy realize their true potential as a clean mode of transport, charging electric vehicles at times of peaks in renewable energy production can help large scale integration of renewable energy in the existing energy infrastructure. We present an agent-based model that investigates the potential contribution of this combination. More specifically, we investigate the potential effects of different kinds of policy interventions on aggregate EV charging patterns. The policy interventions include financial incentives, automated smart charging, information campaigns and social charging. We investigate how well the resulting charging patterns are aligned with renewable energy production and how much they affect user satisfaction of EV drivers. Where possible, we integrate empirical data in our model, to ensure realistic scenarios. We use recent theory from environmental psychology to determine agent behaviour, contrary to earlier simulation models, which have focused only on technical and financial considerations. Based on our simulation results, we articulate some policy recommendations. Furthermore, we point to future research directions for environmental psychology scholars and modelers who want to use theory to inform simulation models of energy systems."
Common Dynamics of Identity and Immigration: The Roles of Mobility and Democracy,Nicolas Houy,"Identity, Immigration, Democracy, Mobility, Schelling Model, Agent-Based Model","We look at the dynamics of identity and immigration in a setting in which political decisions regarding immigration are made by a majoritarian democratic process and location is endogenous. We introduced an agent-based model that allowed us to explain the following facts: When individuals are not allowed to choose their own location, the ratio of immigrants in the population is close to optimal and assimilation works well. On the contrary, when individuals are allowed to move, clusters of different types of populations form. This has the following consequences: assimilation becomes more difficult by formation of closed communities and therefore the native identity can only survive if a large level of immigration is supported by individuals protected from its consequences and vote with local information or consideration. Even in the latter case, temporary outbursts of anti-immigration policy can occur. These results should be understood in the recent context of increasing salience of identity concerns and the following positive electoral results for the so-called populist movements in Western countries."
The Dynamics of Language Minorities: Evidence from an Agent-Based Model of Language Contact,Marco Civico,"Language, Multilingualism, Minority, Complexity, Agent-Based Modelling, Population Dynamics","This article discusses the adoption of a complexity theory approach to study the dynamics of language contact within multilingual communities. It develops an agent-based model that simulates the dynamics of communication within a community where a minority and a majority group coexist. The individual choice of language for communication is based on a number of simple rules derived from a review of the main literature on the topic of language contact. These rules are then combined with different variables, such as the rate of exogamy of the minority group and the presence of relevant education policies, to estimate the trends of assimilation of the minority group into the majority one. The model is validated using actually observed data from the case of Romansh-speakers in the canton of Grisons, Switzerland. The data collected from the simulations are then analysed by means of regression techniques. This paper shows that macro-level language contact dynamics can be explained by relatively simple micro-level behavioural patterns and that intergenerational transmission is crucial for the long-term survival of minority language groups."
Modelling Contingent Technology Adoption in Farming Irrigation Communities,"Antoni Perello-Moragues, Pablo Noriega and Manel Poch","Agent-Based Modeling, Innovation Diffusion, Policy-Making, Irrigation Agriculture, Socio-Hydrology","Of all the uses of water, agriculture is the one that requires the greatest proportion of resources worldwide. Consequently, it is a salient subject for environmental policy-making, and adoption of modern irrigation systems is a key means to improve water use efficiency. In this paper we present an agent-based model of the adoption process —known as ""modernisation""— of a community constituted by farmer agents. The phenomenon is approached as a contingent innovation adoption: a first stage to reach a collective agreement followed by an individual adoption decision. The model is based on historical data from two Spanish irrigation communities during the period 1975-2010. Results suggest that individual profits and farm extension (as proxy of social influence) are suitable assumptions when modelling the modernisation of communities in regions where agriculture is strongly market-oriented and water is scarce. These encouraging results point towards the interest of more sophisticated socio-cognitive modelling within a more realistic socio-hydrologic context."
Space Matters: Extending Sensitivity Analysis to Initial Spatial Conditions in Geosimulation Models,"Juste Raimbault, Clémentine Cottineau, Marion Le Texier, Florent Le Nechet and Romain Reuillon","Space, Initial Conditions, Sensitivity, Agent-Based Models","Although simulation models of socio-spatial systems in general and agent-based models in particular represent a fantastic opportunity to explore socio-spatial behaviours and to test a variety of scenarios for public policy, the validity of generative models is uncertain unless their results are proven robust and representative of 'real-world' conditions. Sensitivity analysis usually includes the analysis of the effect of stochasticity on the variability of results, as well as the effects of small parameter changes. However, initial spatial conditions are usually not modified systematically in socio-spatial models, thus leaving unexplored the effect of initial spatial arrangements on the interactions of agents with one another as well as with their environment. In this article, we present a method to assess the effect of variation of some initial spatial conditions on simulation models, using a systematic geometric structures generator in order to create density grids with which socio-spatial simulation models are initialised. We show, with the example of two classical agent-based models (Schelling's model of segregation and Sugarscape's model of unequal societies) and a straightforward open-source workflow using high performance computing, that the effect of initial spatial arrangements is significant on the two models. We wish to illustrate the potential interest of adding spatial sensitivity analysis during the exploration of models for both modellers and thematic specialists."

We then discuss practical and theoretical problems in the development, validation and assessment of energy-system-analytical ABMS and conclude with an outlook and recommendations for energy system modellers who consider incorporating ABMS into their modelling toolbox."
Agent Scheduling in Opinion Dynamics: A Taxonomy and Comparison Using Generalized Models,"Christopher Weimer, J.O. Miller, Raymond Hill and Douglas Hodson","Opinion Dynamics, Agent-Based Modeling, Scheduling, Asynchronous, Synchronous","Opinion dynamics models are an important field of study within the agent-based modeling community. Agent scheduling elements within existing opinion dynamics models vary but are largely unjustified and only minimally explained. Furthermore, previous research on the impact of scheduling is scarce, partially due to a lack of a common taxonomy with which to discuss and compare schedules. The Synchrony, Actor type, Scale (SAS) taxonomy is presented, which aims to provide a common lexicon for agent scheduling in opinion dynamics models. This is demonstrated using a generalized repeated averaging model (GRAM) and a generalized bounded confidence model (GBCM). Significant differences in model outcomes with varied schedules are given, along with the results of intentional model biasing using only schedule variation. We call on opinion dynamics modelers to make explicit their choice of schedule and to justify that choice based on realistic social phenomena."
A Double-Layer Network and the Contagion Mechanism of China's Financial Systemic Risk,"Lin Zou, Lijuan Xie and Yuanjing Yang","Systemic Risk, Risk Contagion, Double-Layer Network, Interbank Business, Cross-Shareholding","We studied the dynamic mechanism of systemic risk contagion in financial systems with a double-layer network and analysed the factors influencing systemic risk. We used the maximum entropy method to estimate interbank loan data and combined cross-shareholding data among financial institutions to construct a double-layer network structure of China’s financial system, consisting of an interbank lending and a cross-shareholding network. Through simulation, we analysed the nonlinear evolution of the risk contagion process. Numerical results showed that contagious losses in the double-layer network are more than the sum of the losses infecting the interbank lending network and the cross-shareholding network independently. Most of the excess losses are caused by the interbank lending channel. However, if linkages in the cross-shareholding channels are strengthened, excess losses tend to increase. Furthermore, we found that certain specific factors, i.e., the loss rate of assets, the loss given default, total assets, interbank assets and interbank liabilities, have a positive impact on the losses caused by the potential bankruptcy of an institution. We also found that the number of bankruptcies could increase significantly with an increase in the asset loss rate and the loss given default. Our findings suggest certain policy recommendations for managing systemic risk."
How to Manage Individual Forgetting: Analysis and Comparison of Different Knowledge Management Strategies,"Jie Yan, Renjing Liu, Zhengwen He and Xiaobo Wan","Forgetting, Knowledge Management Strategy, Exploration-Exploitation, Agent-Based Modeling","The creation, transfer and retention of knowledge in an organization has always been the focus of knowledge management researchers; however, one aspect of the dynamics of knowledge, i.e., forgetting, has received comparatively limited attention. To fill this research gap, we extend the basic simulation model proposed by March by incorporating forgetting and three knowledge management strategies, i.e., personalization, codification, and mixed, to explore the impacts of different knowledge management strategies and forgetting on the organizational knowledge level. The simulation results not only clarify the specific measures used to manage individual forgetting in each knowledge management strategy but also identify the boundary conditions under which knowledge management strategies should be adopted under different conditions."
Different Modelling Purposes,"Bruce Edmonds, Christophe Le Page, Mike Bithell, Edmund Chattoe-Brown, Volker Grimm, Ruth Meyer, Cristina Montañola-Sales, Paul Ormerod, Hilton Root and Flaminio Squazzoni","Models, Purpose, Prediction, Explanation, Theory, Analogy","How one builds, checks, validates and interprets a model depends on its ‘purpose’. This is true even if the same model code is used for different purposes. This means that a model built for one purpose but then used for another needs to be re-justified for the new purpose and this will probably mean it also has to be re-checked, re-validated and maybe even re-built in a different way. Here we review some of the different purposes for a simulation model of complex social phenomena, focusing on seven in particular: prediction, explanation, description, theoretical exploration, illustration, analogy, and social interaction. The paper looks at some of the implications in terms of the ways in which the intended purpose might fail. This analysis motivates some of the ways in which these ‘dangers’ might be avoided or mitigated. It also looks at the ways that a confusion of modelling purposes can fatally weaken modelling projects, whilst giving a false sense of their quality. These distinctions clarify some previous debates as to the best modelling strategy (e.g. KISS and KIDS). The paper ends with a plea for modellers to be clear concerning which purpose they are justifying their model against."
Contract Farming in the Mekong Delta's Rice Supply Chain: Insights from an Agent-Based Modeling Study,"Hung Khanh Nguyen, Raymond Chiong, Manuel Chica, Richard Middleton and Dung Thi Kim Pham","Agent-Based Modeling, Contract Farming, Agricultural Supply Chain, Computational Simulation","In this paper, we use agent-based modeling (ABM) to study different obstacles to the expansion of contract rice farming in the context of Mekong Delta (MKD)'s rice supply chain. ABM is a bottom-up approach for modeling the dynamics of interactions among individuals and complex combinations of various factors (e.g., economic, social or environmental). Our agent-based contract farming model focuses on two critical components of contractual relationship, namely financial incentives and trust. We incorporate the actual recurrent fluctuations of spot market prices, which induce both contractor and farmer agents to renege on the agreement. The agent-based model is then used to predict emergent system-wide behaviors and compare counterfactual scenarios of different policies and initiatives on maintaining the contract rice farming scheme. Simulation results firstly show that a fully-equipped contractor who opportunistically exploits a relatively small proportion (less than 10%) of the contracted farmers in most instances can outperform spot market-based contractors in terms of average profit achieved for each crop. Secondly, a committed contractor who offers lower purchasing prices than the most typical rate can obtain better earnings per ton of rice as well as higher profit per crop. However, those contractors in both cases could not enlarge their contract farming scheme, since either farmers' trust toward them decreases gradually or their offers are unable to compete with the benefits from a competitor or the spot market. Thirdly, the results are also in agreement with the existing literature that the contract farming scheme is not a cost-effective method for buyers with limited rice processing capacity, which is a common situation among the contractors in the MKD region. These results yield significant insights into the difficulty in expanding the agricultural contracting program in the MKD's rice supply chain."
Learning Opinions by Observing Actions: Simulation of Opinion Dynamics Using an Action-Opinion Inference Model,Tanzhe Tang and Caspar G. Chorus,"Opinion Dynamics, Norm Formation, Voter Model, Behavioral Change","Opinion dynamics models are based on the implicit assumption that people can observe the opinions of others directly, and update their own opinions based on the observation. This assumption significantly reduces the complexity of the process of learning opinions, but seems to be rather unrealistic. Instead, we argue that the opinion itself is unobservable, and that people attempt to infer the opinions of others by observing and interpreting their actions. Building on the notion of Bayesian learning, we introduce an action-opinion inference model (AOI model); this model describes and predicts opinion dynamics where actions are governed by underlying opinions, and each agent changes her opinion according to her inference of others’ opinions from their actions. We study different action-opinion relations in the framework of the AOI model, and show how opinion dynamics are determined by the relations between opinions and actions. We also show that the well-known voter model can be formulated as being a special case of the AOI model when adopting a bijective action-opinion relation. Furthermore, we show that a so-called inclusive opinion, which is congruent with more than one action (in contrast with an exclusive opinion which is only congruent with one action), plays a special role in the dynamic process of opinion spreading. Specifically, the system containing an inclusive opinion always ends up with a full consensus of an exclusive opinion that is incompatible with the inclusive opinion, or with a mixed state of other opinions, including the inclusive opinion itself. A mathematical solution is given for some simple action-opinion relations to help better understand and interpret the simulation results. Finally, the AOI model is compared with the constrained voter model and the language competition model; several avenues for further research are discussed at the end of the paper."
How Group Cohesion Promotes the Emergence of Cooperation in Public Goods Game Under Conditional Dissociation,"Xinglong Qu, Zhigang Cao, Xiaoguang Yang and The Anh Han","Group Cohesion, Public Goods Game, Cooperation Emergence, Conditional Dissociation, Positive Assortment","Leaving is usually an option for individuals if they cannot tolerate their defective partners.	In a two-player game, when a player chooses to leave, both she and her opponent become single players. However, in a multi-player game, the same decision may have different consequences depending on whether group cohesion exists.	Players who choose not to leave would still be united together rather than be separated into singletons if there is cohesion among them. Considering this difference, we study  two  leaving mechanisms in  public goods games. In the first mechanism, every player would be single once any of the group members leaves. In the second, we assume group cohesion exists that members who don't leave form a union. In our model, each player adopts a trigger strategy characterized by a threshold: she leaves if the number of defectors in her group exceeds the threshold. We find that under both mechanisms, when the expected lifespan of individuals is long enough, cooperators with zero tolerance toward defection succeed in the evolution. Moreover, when cohesion exists in groups, cooperation is better promoted because the cooperators have a higher chance to play together. That is, group cohesion facilitates positive assortment and therefore promotes cooperation."
Coevolutionary Characteristics of Knowledge Diffusion and Knowledge Network Structures: A GA-ABM Model,"Junhyok Jang, Xiaofeng Ju, Unsok Ryu and Hyonchol Om","Knowledge Diffusion, Knowledge Network, Coevolutionary, Genetic Algorithm, Agent-Based Modeling","The co-evolutionary dynamics of knowledge diffusion and network structure in knowledge management is a recent research trend in the field of complex networks. The aim of this study is to improve the knowledge diffusion performance of knowledge networks including personnel, innovative organizations and companies. In order to study the co-evolutionary dynamics of knowledge diffusion and network structure, we developed a genetic algorithm-agent based model (GA-ABM) by combining a genetic algorithm (GA) and an agent-based model (ABM). Our simulations show that our GA-ABM improved the average knowledge stock and knowledge growth rate of the whole network, compared with several other models. In addition, it was shown that the topological structure of the optimal network obtained by GA-ABM has the property of a random network. Finally, we found that the clustering coefficients of agents are not significant to improve knowledge diffusion performance."
Synchronizing Histories of Exposure and Demography: The Construction of an Agent-Based Model of the Ecuadorian Amazon Colonization and Exposure to Oil Pollution Hazards,"Noudéhouénou Lionel Jaderne Houssou, Juan Durango Cordero, Audren Bouadjio-Boulic, Lucie Morin, Nicolas Maestripieri, Sylvain Ferrant, Mahamadou Belem, Jose Ignacio Pelaez Sanchez, Melio Saenz, Emilie Lerigoleur, Arnaud Elger, Benoit Gaudou, Laurence Maurice and Mehdi Saqalli","Ecuadorian Amazon, Oil Pollution Exposure, Agent-Based Modeling, Colonization Demography, Historical Modeling Reconstruction","Since the 1970s, the northern part of the Amazonian region of Ecuador has been colonized with the support of intensive oil extraction that has opened up roads and supported the settlement of people from Outside Amazonia. These dynamics have caused important forest cuttings but also regular oil leaks and spills, contaminating both soil and water. The PASHAMAMA Model seeks to simulate these dynamics on both environment and population by examining exposure and demography over time thanks to a retro-prospective and spatially explicit agent-based approach. The aim of the present paper is to describe this model, which integrates two dynamics: (a) Oil companies build roads and oil infrastructures and generate spills, inducing leaks and pipeline ruptures affecting rivers, soils and people. This infrastructure has a probability of leaks, ruptures and other accidents that produce oil pollution affecting rivers, soils and people. (b) New colonists settled in rural areas mostly as close as possible to roads and producing food and/or cash crops. The innovative aspect of this work is the presentation of a qualitative-quantitative approach explicitly addressed to formalize interdisciplinary modeling when data contexts are almost always incomplete."
Network Meta-Metrics: Using Evolutionary Computation to Identify Effective Indicators of Epidemiological Vulnerability in a Livestock Production System Model,"Serge Wiltshire, Asim Zia, Christopher Koliba, Gabriela Bucini, Eric Clark, Scott Merrill, Julie Smith and Susan Moegenburg","Agent-Based Modeling, Network Analytics, Computational Epidemiology, Evolutionary Computation, Livestock Production","We developed an agent-based susceptible/infective model which simulates disease incursions in the hog production chain networks of three U.S. states. Agent parameters, contact network data, and epidemiological spread patterns are output after each model run. Key network metrics are then calculated, some of which pertain to overall network structure, and others to each node's positionality within the network. We run statistical tests to evaluate the extent to which each network metric predicts epidemiological vulnerability, finding significant correlations in some cases, but no individual metric that serves as a reliable risk indicator. To investigate the complex interactions between network structure and node positionality, we use a genetic programming (GP) algorithm to search for mathematical equations describing combinations of individual metrics — which we call 'meta-metrics' - that may better predict vulnerability. We find that the GP solutions — the best of which combine both <i>global</i> and <i>node</i>-level metrics — are far better indicators of disease risk than any individual metric, with meta-metrics explaining up to 91% of the variability in agent vulnerability across all three study areas. We suggest that this methodology could be applied to aid livestock epidemiologists in the targeting of biosecurity interventions, and also that the meta-metric approach may be useful to study a wide range of complex network phenomena."
Path Dependency and Adaptation: The Effects of Policy on Migration Systems,Miranda Simon,"International Migration, Immigration Policy, Return Migration","Social network theory (SNT) holds that, once a critical number of migrants have settled in a destination, migration adopts a self-perpetuating character whereby movement tends to follow the `beaten track.' At this point, the migratory flow between two countries will no longer be strongly correlated to macro-level variables such as immigration policy. This implies that migrants from a given origin will continue to concentrate in the same destination even if other destinations offer easier possibilities for entry. The concentration of immigrants from one origin, predicted by SNT, is widely documented. However, we also see evidence of migrant flows reorienting away from locations where co-ethnics have historically settled. I develop an abstract, theory-driven agent-based model to help reconcile the existence of two apparently mutually exclusive outcomes under the framework of SNT. This model, which considers network-driven labor migration from Mexico to the USA from 1990 to 2013, demonstrates that network theory can explain the emergence of both path dependent migration systems as well as systems that shift in reaction to immigration policy, when return migration is taken into account. Return, a severely understudied aspect of migration, can help migration flows adapt to changes in immigration policy and follow the path of least resistance towards a new destination."
Simulating the Actions of Commuters Using a Multi-Agent System,"Neil Urquhart, Simon Powers, Zoe Wall, Achille Fonzone, Jiaqi Ge and J. Gary Polhill","Transport Mode Choice, Transport Network, BDI Agent","The activity of commuting to and from a place of work affects not only those travelling but also wider society through their contribution to congestion and pollution. It is desirable to have a means of simulating commuting in order to allow organisations to predict the effects of changes to working patterns and locations and inform decision making. In this paper, we outline an agent-based software framework that combines real-world data from multiple sources to simulate the actions of commuters. We demonstrate the framework using data supplied by an employer based in the City of Edinburgh UK. We demonstrate that the BDI-inspired decision-making framework used is capable of forecasting the transportation modes to be used. Finally, we present a case study, demonstrating the use of the framework to predict the impact of moving staff within the organisation to a new work site."
Endogenous Changes in Public Opinion Dynamics,Francisco J. León-Medina,"Opinion Dynamics, Mechanism Explanation, Agent-Based Modeling, Homophily, Social Influence, Social Network","Opinion dynamics models usually center on explaining how macro-level regularities in public opinion (uniformity, polarization or clusterization) emerge as the effect of local interactions of a population with an initial random distribution of opinions. However, with only a few exceptions, the understanding of patterns of public opinion change has generally been dismissed in this literature. To address this theoretical gap in our understanding of opinion dynamics, we built a multi-agent simulation model that could help to identify some mechanisms underlying changes in public opinion. Our goal was to build a model whose behavior could show different types of endogenously (not induced by the researcher) triggered transitions (rapid or slow, radical or soft). The paper formalizes a situation where agents embedded in different types of networks (random, small world and scale free networks) interact with their neighbors and express an opinion that is the result of different mechanisms: a coherence mechanism, in which agents try to stick to their previously expressed opinions; an assessment mechanism, in which agents consider available external information on the topic; and a social influence mechanism, in which agents tend to approach their neighbor’s opinions. According to our findings, only scale-free networks show fluctuations in public opinion. Public opinion changes in this model appear as a diffusion process of individual opinion shifts that is triggered by an opinion change of a highly connected agent. The frequency, rapidity and radicalness of the diffusion, and hence of public opinion fluctuations, positively depends on how influential external information is in individual opinions and negatively depends on how homophilic social interactions are."
The Evolution of Tribalism: A Social-Ecological Model of Cooperation and Inter-Group Conflict Under Pastoralism,Nicholas Seltzer,"Evolution, Cooperation, Inter-Group, Conflict, Warfare, Tribal","This study investigates a possible nexus between inter-group competition and intra-group cooperation, which may be called &quot;tribalism.&quot; Building upon previous studies demonstrating a relationship between the environment and social relations, the present research incorporates a social-ecological model as a mediating factor connecting both individuals and communities to the environment. Cyclical and non-cyclical fluctuation in a simple, two-resource ecology drive agents to adopt either &quot;go-it-alone&quot; or group-based survival strategies via evolutionary selection. Novelly, this simulation employs a multilevel selection model allowing group-level dynamics to exert downward selective pressures on individuals' propensity to cooperate within groups. Results suggest that cooperation and inter-group conflict are co-evolved in a triadic relationship with the environment. Resource scarcity increases inter-group competition, especially when resources are clustered as opposed to widely distributed. Moreover, the tactical advantage of cooperation in the securing of clustered resources enhanced selective pressure on cooperation, even if that implies increased individual mortality for the most altruistic warriors. Troubling, these results suggest that extreme weather, possibly as a result of climate change, could exacerbate conflict in sensitive, weather-dependent social-ecologies---especially places like the Horn of Africa where ecologically sensitive economic modalities overlap with high-levels of diversity and the wide-availability of small arms. As well, global development and foreign aid strategists should consider how plans may increase the value of particular locations where community resources are built or aid is distributed, potentially instigating tribal conflict. In sum, these factors, interacting with pre-existing social dynamics dynamics, may heighten inter-ethnic or tribal conflict in pluralistic but otherwise peaceful communities."
Participatory Modeling and Simulation with the GAMA Platform,"Patrick Taillandier, Arnaud Grignard, Nicolas Marilleau, Damien Philippon, Quang-Nghi Huynh, Benoit Gaudou and Alexis Drogoul","Agent-Based Simulation, Participatory Modeling, Participatory Simulation, Serious Game","In recent years, agent-based simulation has become an important tool to study complex systems. However, the models produced are rarely used for decision-making support because stakeholders are often not involved in the modeling and simulation processes. Indeed, if several tools dedicated to participatory modeling and simulation exist, they are limited to the design of simple - KISS - models, which limit their potential impact. In this article, we present the participatory tools integrated within the GAMA modeling and simulation platform. These tools, which take advantage of the GAMA platform concerning the definition of rich - KIDS - models, allows to build models graphically and develop distributed serious games in a simple way. Several application examples illustrate their use and potential."
ABOOMS: Overcoming the Hurdles of Continuous-Time Public Goods Games with a Simulation-Based Approach,"Tuong Manh Vu, Christian Wagner and Peer-Olaf Siebers","Agent-Based Modelling and Simulation, Continuous-Time Public Goods Game, Software Engineering, Agent-Based Computational Economics, Object-Oriented Analysis and Design","Public Goods Games (PGGs) are a standard experimental economic approach to studying cooperative behaviour. There are two types of games: discrete-time and continuous-time PGGs. While discrete-time PGGs (one-shot decisions about contributions to public goods) can be easily done as lab experiments, continuous-time PGGs (where participants can change contributions at any time) are much harder to realise within a lab environment. This is mainly because it is difficult to consider events happening in continuous time in lab experiments. Simulation offers an opportunity to support real-world lab experiments and is well suited to explore continuous-time PGGs. In this paper, we show how to apply our recently developed ABOOMS (Agent-Based Object-Oriented Modelling and Simulation) development framework to create models for simulation-supported continuous-time PGG studies. The ABOOMS framework utilizes Software Engineering techniques to support the development at the macro level (considering the overall study lifecycle) and at the micro level (considering individual steps related to simulation model development). Our case study shows that outputs from the simulation-supported continuous-time PGG generate dynamics that do not exist in discrete-time setting, highlighting the fact that it is important to study both, discrete and continuous-time PGGs."
Review of Modelling and Simulating Crowds at Mass Gathering Events: Hajj as a Case Study,"Almoaid Owaidah, Doina Olaru, Mohammed Bennamoun, Ferdous Sohel and Nazim Khan","Hajj, Crowd Modelling, Crowd Simulation, Big/special Events, Mass Gathering","The Hajj is an Islamic pilgrimage that involves four main holy sites in Makkah, Saudi Arabia. As the number of participants (pilgrims) attending these events has been increasing over the years, challenges have arisen: overcrowding at the sites resulting in congestion, pilgrims getting lost, stampedes, injuries and even deaths. Although Hajj management authorities have employed up-to-date facilities to manage the events (e.g., state-of-the-art infrastructure and communication technologies, CCTV monitoring, live crowd analysis, time scheduling, and large well-trained police forces and scouts), there is still overcrowding and “unexpected” problems that can occur at the events. These problems can be studied and mitigated by prior simulation, which allows for preparation and deployment of the most appropriate plans for crowd management at Hajj events. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of crowd modelling and simulation studies referring to Hajj."
A Dynamic Sustainability Analysis of Energy Landscapes in Egypt: A Spatial Agent-Based Model Combined with Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis,"Mostafa Shaaban, Jürgen Scheffran, Jürgen Böhner and Mohamed S. Elsobki","Energy Security, Energy Landscape, Egypt, Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis, Agent-Based Modeling, Geographic Information System","To respond to the emerging challenge of climate change, feasible strategies need to be formulated towards sustainable development and energy security on a national and international level. Lacking a dynamic sustainability assessment of technologies for electricity planning, this paper fills the gap with a multi-criteria and multi-stakeholder evaluation in an integrated assessment of energy systems. This allows to select the most preferred strategies for future planning of energy security in Egypt, with a focus on alternative energy pathways and a sustainable electricity supply mix up to 2100. A novel prototype model is used to integrate multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) as a premium decision support approach with agent-based modeling (ABM). This tool is popular in analyzing dynamic complex systems. A GIS-based spatial ABM analyzes future pathways for energy security in Egypt, depending on the preferences of agents for selected criteria to facilitate the transformation of energy landscapes. The study reveals significant temporal variations in the spatial ranking of technologies between actors in the energy sector over this period. We conclude that in order to attain a sustainable energy landscape, we should involve relevant stakeholders and analyze their interactions while considering local spatial conditions and key dimensions of sustainable development."
Conflicts Induced by Different Responses to Land Expropriation Among the Farmers Involved During Urbanization in China,"Haijun Bao, Xiaohe Wu, Haowen Wang, Qiuxiang Li, Yi Peng and Shibao Lu","Conflict of Interests, Land Expropriation, Evolutionary Game, Multi-Agent Simulation, Farmers","Expropriation of collectively-owned land has become an important realistic path for achieving urban development and new urbanization in China considering the shortage of state-owned land. During this process, farmers involved in land expropriation are often in conflict with one another because of the asymmetry of their interests. Such conflicts have a considerable effect on social harmony and stability. However, few studies have investigated such conflict of interests between farmers. Therefore, this research analyzed game behavior for the conflict of interests among farmers. A two-dimensional symmetric evolutionary game model and a multi-agent simulation experiment were used to explore the conflicts induced by the farmers’ different responses to land expropriation. This research finds that the changing strategy choices of farmers in the evolutionary game on collectively owned land expropriation are the main reasons for the occurrence of villager’ confrontations and “nail households”. Results provide targeted policy recommendations for local governments to promote cooperation among farmers, thereby enhancing social harmony. The findings also serve as references for other countries and regions in dealing with intra-conflict of interests in land expropriation."
Comparing Spatial-Interaction and Hybrid Agent-Based Modelling Approaches: An Application to Location Analysis of Services,Lukasz Kowalski,"Agent-Based Model, Spatial Interaction Model, Hybrid Model, Firm Location, Time-Space","Aggregated models, such as spatial interaction (SIM) models are widely used in location analysis. Despite their popularity, there are certain limitations to their use. In particular, the method struggles to account for the passing-by population and multi-purpose trips of retail clients, temporal changes in accessibility and some bottom-up processes potentially important for services. Agent-based modelling (ABM) is a promising technique that attempts to address all these problems. However, it still lacks examples of real-world applications. This article aims to provide an example of how hybrid ABM (H-ABM) can be built on a SIM foundation, by incorporating most of its ideas, such as distance-decay function, facility attractiveness parameters and demand elasticity. The author aligns the two models as close as possible and compares their input data, calibration procedures and results. In the final analysis, the hybrid agent-based model proved to be more realistic because it incorporated the time-space variability of supply (i.e., limited numbers of available places in swimming pools), demand (the popularity of certain entry hours) and transport (traffic jams during rush hours). The spatial interaction model was much faster to execute and turned out to be more convenient for more straightforward applications, which do not require detailed data concerning individuals."
Impact of Basel III Countercyclical Measures on Financial Stability: An Agent-Based Model,Barbara Llacay and Gilbert Peffer,"Agent-Based Simulation, Financial Markets, Financial Stability, Value-At-Risk, Countercyclical Regulation, Basel III","The financial system is inherently procyclical, as it amplifies the course of economic cycles, and precisely one of the factors that has been suggested to exacerbate this procyclicality is the Basel regulation on capital requirements. After the recent credit crisis, international regulators have turned their eyes to countercyclical regulation as a solution to avoid similar episodes in the future. Countercyclical regulation aims at preventing excessive risk taking during booms to reduce the impact of losses suffered during recessions, for example increasing the capital requirements during the good times to improve the resilience of financial institutions at the downturn. The Basel Committee has already moved forward towards the adoption of countercyclical measures on a global scale: the Basel III Accord, published in December 2010, revises considerably the capital requirement rules to reduce their procyclicality. These new countercyclical measures will not be completely implemented until 2019, so their impact cannot be evaluated yet, and it is a crucial question whether they will be effective in reducing procyclicality and the appearance of crisis episodes such as the one experienced in 2007-08. For this reason, we present in this article an agent-based model aimed at analysing the effect of two countercyclical mechanisms introduced in Basel III: the countercyclical buffer and the stressed VaR. In particular, we focus on the impact of these mechanisms on the procyclicality induced by market risk requirements and, more specifically, by value-at-risk models, as it is a issue of crucial importance that has received scant attention in the modeling literature. The simulation results suggest that the adoption of both of these countercyclical measures improves market stability and reduces the emergence of crisis episodes."
The Impact of Potential Crowd Behaviours on Emergency Evacuation: An Evolutionary Game-Theoretic Approach,"Azhar Mohd Ibrahim, Ibrahim Venkat and De Wilde Philippe","Evacuation Model, Evolution of Crowd Behaviour, Crowd Disaster, Evolutionary Game Theory","Crowd dynamics have important applications in evacuation management systems relevant to organizing safer large scale gatherings. For crowd safety, it is very important to study the evolution of potential crowd behaviours by simulating the crowd evacuation process. Planning crowd control tasks by studying the impact of crowd behaviour evolution towards evacuation could mitigate the possibility of crowd disasters. During a typical emergency evacuation scenario, conflict among agents occurs when agents intend to move to the same location as a result of the interaction with their nearest neighbours. The effect of the agent response towards their neighbourhood is vital in order to understand the effect of variation of crowd behaviour on the whole environment. In this work, we model crowd motion subject to exit congestion under uncertainty conditions in a continuous space via computer simulations. We model best-response, risk-seeking, risk-averse and risk-neutral behaviours of agents via certain game-theoretic notions. We perform computer simulations with heterogeneous populations in order to study the effect of the evolution of agent behaviours towards egress flow under threat conditions. Our simulation results show the relation between the local crowd pressure and the number of injured agents. We observe that when the proportion of agents in a population of risk-seeking agents is increased, the average crowd pressure, average local density and the number of injured agents increases. Besides that, based on our simulation results, we can infer that crowd disasters could be prevented if the agent population consists entirely of risk-averse and risk-neutral agents despite circumstances that lead to threats."
Innovation and Employment: An Agent-Based Approach,"Fábio Neves, Pedro Campos and Sandra Silva","Agent-Based Model, Innovation, Automation, Employment","While the effects of innovation on employment have been a controversial issue in economic literature for several years, this economic puzzle is particularly relevant nowadays. We are witnessing tremendous technological developments which threaten to disrupt the labour market, due to their potential for significantly automating human labour. As such, this paper presents a qualitative study of the dynamics underlying the relationship between innovation and employment, using an agent-based model developed in Python. The model represents an economy populated by firms able to perform either Product Innovation (leading to the discovery of new tasks, which require human labour) or Process Innovation (leading to the automation of tasks previously performed by humans). The analysis led to three major conclusions, valid in this context. The first takeaway is that the Employment Rate in a given economy is dependent on the automation potential of the tasks in that economy and dependent on the type of innovation performed by firms in that economy (with Product Innovation having a positive effect on employment and Process Innovation having a negative effect). Second, in any given economy, if firms’ propensity for product and process innovation, as well as the automation potential of their tasks are stable over time, the Employment Rate in that economy will tend towards stability over time. The third conclusion is that higher levels of Process Innovation and lower levels of Product Innovation, lead to a more intense decline of wage shares and to a wider gap between employee productivity growth and wage growth."
"Entrepreneurial Team Learning, Forgetting and Knowledge Levels in Business Incubators: An Exploration and Exploitation Perspective","Wenqing Wu, Saixiang Ma, Kai Wang, Sang-Bing Tsai and Wen-Pin Lin","Entrepreneurial Team, Exploration·Exploitation, Business Incubator, Environmental Changes, Forgetting","Exploration and exploitation are common in entrepreneurial teams. This paper considers the relationship among entrepreneurial teams in business incubators (BIETs)  and the relationship between the leader and members of BIETs. It examines the effects of BIETs’ learning, forgetting and exit and entry on their knowledge level (KL)  in different environments and models two general situations involving the development and use of knowledge in BIETs and business incubators. The results indicate that in a static environment, the rate of BIETs learning from each other and BIETs’ equilibrium KL are negatively correlated, but a moderate rate of forgetting leads to a positive correlation. Second, in a static environment, within a BIET, the combination of the leader learning from members quickly and members learning from the leader slowly can improve BIETs’ KL. However, with forgetting, improving BIETs’ KL requires a combination of fast learning by the leader and moderate learning by members. Third, in a dynamic environment, maintaining a moderate amount of exit and entry and forgetting within BIETs moderately improves BIETs’ KL in the long run; this effect is even more significant with BIETs’ exit and entry."
Community-Based Adoption and Diffusion of Micro-Grids: Analysis of the Italian Case with Agent-Based Model,Francesco Pasimeni,"Micro-Grids, Agent-Based Model, Innovation Diffusion, Energy Transition","The electricity generation and distribution system in many developed economies is based primarily on the centralised grid. However, there is a need to shift from this traditional system to a newly more decentralised electricity system. This paper explores possible scenarios of adoption and diffusion of Micro-Grids (MGs) in Italy. An agent-based model is formulated to simulate the diffusion process as function of regional factors, subsidies and people's attitude. It assumes that MGs are purchased directly by communities of neighbours, which benefit from cost sharing. Results show high dependence of the diffusion process on regional factors: electricity demand, renewable potential and population. The model confirms that subsidies boost diffusion, mainly when they are regional-based rather than national-based. Higher green attitude accelerates diffusion and reduces environmental impact of the electricity system."
Promoting Sustainable Food Consumption: An Agent-Based Model About Outcomes of  Small Shop Openings,"Roberto Calisti, Primo Proietti and Andrea Marchini","Sustainable Consumption, Agent-Based Modelling, Farmers’ Market, Consumer Behaviour, Consumer Networks, Location-Allocation Problem","A useful way of promoting sustainable food consumption is to consider the spread of food retail operations focused on food diversification, food specialization, and fresh and local products. These food shops are generally small, which is a great problem for survival against ruthless competition from supermarkets. Our research objective was to construct a simulation with an agent-based model, reproducing the local food consumption market and to investigate how a new, small food retailing shop interacts with this market. As a case study, the model simulates the opening of a small farmers’ market. The intent of the model is to reproduce the current status of consumption for food products within a certain territorial context and given time period, and to investigate how consumers’ behaviour changes with the opening of the new shop. As a result, we could predict changes in consumers’ habits, the economic positioning of new, small shops and its best location. This information is of considerable interest for farmers’ markets and also for policymakers."
An Agent-Based Assessment of Health Vulnerability to Long-Term Particulate Exposure in Seoul Districts,Hyesop Shin and Mike Bithell,"PM<sub>10</sub>, Exposure, Health Vulnerability, Agent-Based Model (ABM), Seoul","This study presents a proof-of-concept agent-based model (ABM) of health vulnerability to long-term exposure to airborne particulate pollution, specifically to particles less than 10 micrometres in size (PM<sub>10</sub>), in Seoul, Korea. We estimated the differential effects of individual behaviour and social class across heterogeneous space in two districts, Gwanak and Gangnam. Three scenarios of seasonal PM<sub>10</sub> change (business as usual: BAU, exponential increase: INC, and exponential decrease: DEC) and three scenarios of resilience were investigated, comparing the vulnerability rate both between and within each district. Our first result shows that the vulnerable groups in both districts, including those aged over 65, aged under 15, and with a low education level, increased sharply after 5,000 ticks (each tick corresponding to 1 day). This implies that disparities in health outcomes can be explained by socioeconomic status (SES), especially when the group is exposed over a long period. Additionally, while the overall risk population was larger in Gangnam in the AC100 scenarios, the recovery level from resilience scenarios decreased the risk population substantially, for example from 7.7% to 0.7%. Our second finding from the local-scale analysis indicates that most Gangnam sub-districts showed more variation both spatially and in different resilience scenarios, whereas Gwanak areas showed a uniform pattern regardless of earlier prevention. The implication for policy is that, while some areas, such as Gwanak, clearly require urgent mitigating action, areas like Gangnam may show a greater response to simpler corrections, but aggregating up to the district scale may miss particular areas that are more at risk. Future work should consider other pollutants as well as more sophisticated population and pollution modelling, coupled with explicit representation of transport and more careful treatment of individual doses and the associated health responses."
The Value of Values and Norms in Social Simulation,"Rijk Mercuur, Virginia Dignum and Catholijn Jonker","Human Values, Norms, Ultimatum Game, Empirical Data, Agent-Based Model","Social simulations gain strength when agent behaviour can (1) represent human behaviour and (2) be explained in understandable terms. Agents with values and norms lead to simulation results that meet human needs for explanations, but have not been tested on their ability to reproduce human behaviour. This paper compares empirical data on human behaviour to simulated data on agents with values and norms in a psychological experiment on dividing money: the ultimatum game. We find that our agent model with values and norms produces aggregate behaviour that falls within the 95% confidence interval wherein human behaviour lies more often than other tested agent models. A main insight is that values serve as a static component in agent behaviour, whereas norms serve as a dynamic component."
An Agent-Based Model of Rural Households’ Adaptation to Climate Change,"Atesmachew Hailegiorgis, Andrew Crooks and Claudio Cioffi-Revilla","Climate Change Adaptation, Agent-Based Modeling, Socio-Cognitive Behavior","Future climate change is expected to have greater impacts on societies whose livelihoods rely on subsistence agricultural systems. Adaptation is essential for mitigating adverse effects of climate change, to sustain rural livelihoods and ensure future food security. We present an agent-based model, called OMOLAND-CA, which explores the impact of climate change on the adaptive capacity of rural communities in the South Omo Zone of Ethiopia. The purpose of the model is to answer research questions on the resilience and adaptive capacity of rural households with respect to variations in climate, socioeconomic factors, and land-use at the local level. Our model explicitly represents the socio-cognitive behavior of rural households toward climate change and resource flows that prompt agents to diversify their production strategy under different climatic conditions. Results from the model show that successive episodes of extreme events (e.g., droughts) affect the adaptive capacity of households, causing them to migrate from the region. Nonetheless, rural communities in the South Omo Zone, and in the model, manage to endure in spite of such harsh climatic change conditions."
Identifying Mechanisms Underlying Peer Effects on Multiplex Networks,"Hang Xiong, Diane Payne and Stephen Kinsella","Peer Effects, Social Networks, Diffusion of Innovation, High-Value Crop","We separately identify two mechanisms underlying peer effects in farm households' adoption of a new crop. A farmer can follow his peers to adopt a new crop because he learns knowledge about the new crop from them (social learning) and because he wants to avoid the damage caused by the practice conflicting with theirs (externalities). Using an agent-based model, we simulate the two mechanisms on a multiplex network consisting of two types of social relationships. The simulation model is estimated using detailed data of social networks, adoption and relevant socio-economic characteristics from 10 villages in China. We find that social learning -- in this case, the sharing of experiential resources -- among family members and production externalities between contiguous land plots both significantly influence farmers' adoption. Furthermore, sharing of experiential resources plays a significant role in the entire diffusion process and dominates the early phase, whereas externalities only matter in the late phase. This study shows the roles peer effects play in shaping diffusion can occur through different mechanisms and can vary as the diffusion proceeds. The work also suggests that agent-based models can help disentangle the role of social interactions in promoting or hindering diffusion."
The Ecosystems of Simple and Complex Societies: Social and Geographical Dynamics,"Ricardo Andrés Guzmán, Sammy Drobny and Carlos Rodríguez-Sickert","Social Stratification, Agricultural Intensification, Territorial War, Civil Wars, Malthusian Dynamics, Spatial Models","We present a spatial agent-based model of the emergence and proliferation of premodern complex societies in an isolated region initially inhabited by simple societies. At the intrasocietal level, the model integrates scalar stress, social fission, sociocultural evolution, societal collapse, and Malthusian-Ricardian demographic dynamics. At the geographical level, the model includes warfare for territory and captives, territorial division due to social conflict, and territorial disintegration due to collapse. We found that a single variable---slow, continuous progress in intensive agriculture---drives the social and geographical dynamics. Consistent with the archaeological and historical record, the model produced three consecutive 'eras': During the first era, simple societies dominate the region. They use extensive food production methods. Small complex societies of intensive agriculturists emerge intermittently in the core land, where intensification is feasible. Shortly after, they collapse or are annihilated by local simple societies. During the second era, some complex societies avert early collapse and annihilation. They expand by conquest. At all times, they coexist with simple societies. Some complex societies are destroyed in war; others collapse. From time to time, complex societies collapse en masse. During the third era, there are no more mass collapses. Complex societies slowly expand until they dominate the core land. Simple societies take refuge in the marginal land, where intensification is infeasible. Simple and complex societies coexist, separated by a moving frontier. In an ebb and flow, complex societies expand to the marginal land and withdraw to the core land. The results of the simulations are qualitatively consistent with prehistorical and historical case studies. The model replicates the progression from simple to more complex societies, and explains why that progression happened in fits and starts."
"The Insurance Industry as a Complex Social System: Competition, Cycles and Crises","Iqbal Owadally, Feng Zhou and Douglas Wright","Underwriting Cycle, Insurance Crisis, Theory of Plural Rationalities, Underwriter, Actuary","Insurance is critical to the fabric of modern societies and economies, but the insurance industry continues to suffer deep cycles and periodic crises. These have a great socio-economic cost as insurance cover can become prohibitively expensive or unavailable, damaging livelihoods, property, belongings and employment. These phenomena are poorly understood. A set of socio-anthropological and behavioural hypotheses have recently been posited. We investigate these explanations by means of an agent-based simulation model. The model is parameterized on actual property insurance industry data and is carefully validated. Our main result is that simple behaviour and interaction at the individual level can result in complex cyclical industry-wide behaviour. Heterogeneity and interaction at a micro level must therefore be understood if cycles and crises in the insurance industry are to be managed and prevented."
Towards the Right Ordering of the Sequence of Models for the Evolution of a Population Using Agent-Based Simulation,"Morgane Dumont, Johan Barthelemy, Nam Huynh and Timoteo Carletti","Microsimulation, Agent-Based Modelling, Ordering of Models, Population Evolution, Robustness","Agent based modelling is nowadays widely used in transport and the social science. Forecasting population evolution and analysing the impact of hypothetical policies are often the main goal of these developments. Such models are based on sub-models defining the interactions of agents either with other agents or with their environment. Sometimes, several models represent phenomena arising at the same time in the real life. Hence, the question of the order in which these sub-models need to be applied is very relevant for simulation outcomes. This paper aims to analyse and quantify the impact of the change in the order of sub-models on an evolving population modelled using TransMob. This software simulates the evolution of the population of a metropolitan area in South East of Sydney (Australia). It includes five principal models: ageing, death, birth, marriage and divorce. Each possible order implies slightly different results mainly driven by how agents' ageing is defined with respect to death. Furthermore, we present a calendar-based approach for the ordering that decreases the variability of final populations. Finally, guidelines are provided proposing general advices and recommendations for researchers designing discrete time agent-based models."
"Explaining the Emerging Influence of Culture, from Individual Influences to Collective Phenomena",Loïs Vanhée and Frank Dignum,"Cultures, Social Simulations, Agent-Based Modelling","This paper presents a simulation model and derived from it a theory to explain how known cultural influences on individual decisions lead to collective phenomena. This simulation models the evolution of a business organization, replicating key micro-level cultural influences on individual decisions (such as allocating and accepting tasks) and subsequent macro-level collective cultural phenomena (such as robustness and sensitivity to environmental complexity). As a result, we derived a theory on how to relate the influence of culture from individual decisions to collective outcomes, based on this simulation. We also point out that cultures appear to be related to specific sets of abstract, coherent and recurrent interaction patterns between individuals."
Automated Analysis of Regularities Between Model Parameters and Output Using Support Vector Regression in Conjunction with Decision Trees,Mert Edali and Gönenç Y&uuml;cel,"Decision Tree, MetaModel, R, Rule Extraction, Support Vector Regression, Traffic","Opening the black-box of nonlinear relationships between model inputs and outputs, significantly contributes to the understanding of the dynamic problem being studied. Considering the weaknesses and disadvantages of human-guided and systematic techniques offered in the literature, this paper presents a model analysis and exploration tool for agent-based models. The tool first approximates input-output relationships by developing a metamodel, a simplified representation of the original agent-based model. For this purpose, it utilizes support vector regression, which is capable of approximating highly nonlinear systems accurately. Following metamodel fitting, the tool incorporates a tree-based method to extract knowledge embedded in the metamodel. The resulting tree is then expressed as a set of IF-THEN rules that have high comprehensibility compared to complex metamodel function. We utilized the tool for the exploration of Traffic Basic model and the results show the relationship between model input and output. Furthermore, rules extracted from the metamodel point out certain counter-intuitive results of the model which are not easily inferred from the raw input-output data. We also discuss potential uses of our tool and provide the R script which makes the analysis repeatable for other agent-based models."
"Task Structure, Individual Bounded Rationality and Crowdsourcing Performance: An Agent-Based Simulation Approach","Jie Yan, Renjing Liu and Guangjun Zhang","Crowdsourcing, Task Structure, Bounded Rationality, TCPE Framework, NK Model","Crowdsourcing is increasingly employed by enterprises outsourcing certain internal problems to external boundedly rational problem solvers who may be more efficient. However, despite the relative abundance of crowdsourcing research, how the matching relationship between task types and solver types works is far from clear. This study intends to clarify this issue by investigating the interplay between task structure and individual bounded rationality on crowdsourcing performance. For this purpose, we have introduced interaction relationships of task decisions to define three differently structured tasks, i.e., local tasks, small-world tasks and random tasks. We also consider bounded rationality, considering two dimensions i.e., bounded rationality level used to distinguish industry types, and bounded rationality bias used to differentiate professional users from ordinary users. This agent-based model (ABM) is constructed by combining NK fitness landscape with the TCPE (Task-Crowd-Process-Evaluation), a framework depicting crowdsourcing processes, to simulate the problem-solving process of tournament-based crowdsourcing. Results would suggest that under the same task complexity, random tasks are more difficult to complete than local tasks. This is evident in emerging industries, where the bounded rationality level of solvers is generally low, regardless of the type of solvers, local tasks always perform best and random tasks worst. However, in traditional industries, where the bounded rationality level of solvers is generally higher, when solvers are ordinary users, local tasks perform best, followed by small-world and then random tasks. When solvers are more expert, random tasks perform best, followed by small-world and then local tasks, but the gap between these three tasks in crowdsourcing performance is not immediately obvious. When solvers are professional, random tasks perform best, followed by small-world and then local tasks, and the gap between these three tasks in crowdsourcing performance is obvious."
A Generative Model of the Mutual Escalation of Anxiety Between Religious Groups,"F. LeRon Shults, Ross Gore, Wesley J. Wildman, Christopher Lynch, Justin E. Lane and Monica Toft","Agent-Based Model, Religious Violence, Identity Fusion, Social Identity, Terror Management, Xenophobia","We propose a generative agent-based model of the emergence and escalation of xenophobic anxiety in which individuals from two different religious groups encounter various hazards within an artificial society. The architecture of the model is informed by several empirically validated theories about the role of religion in intergroup conflict. Our results identify some of the conditions and mechanisms that engender the intensification of anxiety within and between religious groups. We define mutually escalating xenophobic anxiety as the increase of the average level of anxiety of the agents in both groups over time. Trace validation techniques show that the most common conditions under which longer periods of mutually escalating xenophobic anxiety occur are those in which the difference in the size of the groups is not too large and the agents experience social and contagion hazards at a level of intensity that meets or exceeds their thresholds for those hazards. Under these conditions agents will encounter out-group members more regularly, and perceive them as threats, generating mutually escalating xenophobic anxiety. The model’s capacity to grow the macro-level emergence of this phenomenon from micro-level agent behaviors and interactions provides the foundation for future work in this domain."
Opinion Dynamics Model Based on Cognitive Biases of Complex Agents,Pawel Sobkowicz,"Opinion Change, Motivated Reasoning, Confirmation Bias, Complex Agents, Agent Based Model","We present an introduction to a novel way of simulating individual and group opinion dynamics, taking into account how various sources of information are filtered due to cognitive biases. The agent-based model presented here falls into the ‘complex agent’ category, in which the agents are described in considerably greater detail than in the simplest ‘spinson’ model. To describe agents’ information processing, we introduced mechanisms of updating individual belief distributions, relying on information processing. The open nature of this proposed model allows us to study the effects of various static and time-dependent biases and information filters. In particular, the paper compares the effects of two important psychological mechanisms: confirmation bias and politically motivated reasoning. This comparison has been prompted by recent experimental psychology work by Dan Kahan. Depending on the effectiveness of information filtering (agent bias), agents confronted with an objective information source can either reach a consensus based on truth, or remain divided despite the evidence. In general, this model might provide understanding into increasingly polarized modern societies, especially as it allows us to mix different types of filters: e.g., psychological, social, and algorithmic."
Using a Socioeconomic Segregation Burn-in Model to Initialise an Agent-Based Model for Infectious Diseases,"Elizabeth Hunter, Brian Mac Namee and John D. Kelleher","Agent-Based, Socioeconomic Status, Infectious Disease, Simulation, Segregation, Model",Socioeconomic status can have an important effect on health. In this paper we: (i) propose using house price data as a publicly available proxy for socioeconomic status to examine neighbourhood socioeconomic status at a more fine grained resolution than is available in Irish Central Statistics Office data; (ii) use a dissimilarity index to demonstrate and measure the existence of socioeconomic clustering at a neighbourhood level; (iii) demonstrate that using a standard ABM initialisation process based on CSO small area data results in ABMs systematically underestimating the socioeconomic clustering in Irish neighbourhoods; (iv) demonstrate that ABM models are better calibrated towards socioeconomic clustering after a segregation models has been run for a burn-in period after initial model setup; and (v) that running a socieconomic segregation model during the initiation of an ABM epidemiology model can have an effect on the outbreak patterns of the model. Our results support the use of segregation models as useful additions to the initiation process of ABM for epidemiology.
Countries as Agents in a Global-Scale Computational Model,"Harold J. Walbert, James L. Caton and Julia R. Norgaard","Agent Based Modeling, Conflict Resolution, Tribute, Diplomacy, War, Economic Analysis of Conflict","Our agent-based model examines the ramifications of formal defense agreements between countries.  Our model builds on previous work and creates an empirically based version of a tribute model in which actors within existing real-world networks demand tribute from one another.  If the threatened actor does not pay the tribute, the aggressing actor will engage in a decision to start a war.  Tribute and war payments are based on a measure of the country's wealth. We utilize the Correlates of War dataset to provide us with worldwide historical defense alliance information.  Using these networks as our initial conditions, we run the model forward from four prominent historical years and simulate the interactions that take place as well as the changes in overall wealth.  Agents in the model employ a cost benefit analysis in their decision of whether or not to go to war.  This model provides results that are in qualitative agreement with historical emergent macro outcomes seen over time."
Generating Synthetic Bitcoin Transactions and Predicting Market Price Movement Via Inverse Reinforcement Learning and Agent-Based Modeling,"Kamwoo Lee, Sinan Ulkuatam, Peter Beling and William Scherer","Cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, Inverse Reinforcement Learning, Agent-Based Modeling","In this paper, we present a novel method to predict Bitcoin price movement utilizing inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) and agent-based modeling (ABM). Our approach consists of predicting the price through reproducing synthetic yet realistic behaviors of rational agents in a simulated market, instead of estimating relationships between the price and price-related factors. IRL provides a systematic way to find the behavioral rules of each agent from Blockchain data by framing the trading behavior estimation as a problem of recovering motivations from observed behavior and generating rules consistent with these motivations. Once the rules are recovered, an agent-based model creates hypothetical interactions between the recovered behavioral rules, discovering equilibrium prices as emergent features through matching the supply and demand of Bitcoin. One distinct aspect of our approach with ABM is that while conventional approaches manually design individual rules, our agents’ rules are channeled from IRL. Our experimental results show that the proposed method can predict short-term market price while outlining overall market trend."
Agent-Based Models of Gender Inequalities in Career Progression,John Bullinaria,"Agent-Based Models, Gender Inequalities, Career Preferences, Social Learning, Evolution","An agent-based simulation framework is presented that provides a principled approach for investigating gender inequalities in professional hierarchies such as universities or businesses.  Populations of artificial agents compete for promotion in their chosen professions, leading to emergent distributions that can be matched to real-life scenarios, and allowing the influence of socially or genetically acquired career preferences to be explored.  The aim is that such models will enable better understanding of how imbalances emerge and evolve, facilitate the identification of specific signals that can indicate the presence or absence of discrimination, and provide a tool for determining how and when particular intervention strategies may be appropriate for rectifying any inequalities.  Results generated from a representative series of abstract case studies involving innate or culturally-acquired gender-based ability differences, gender-based discrimination, and various forms of gender-specific career preferences, demonstrate the power of the approach.  These simulations will hopefully inspire and facilitate better approaches for dealing with these issues in real life."
Agent-Based Modelling of Viticulture Development in Emerging Markets: The Case of the Małopolska Region,"Marcin Czupryna, Paweł Oleksy, Piotr Przybek and Bogumił Kamiński","Agent-Based Modelling, Market Development, Behavioural Factors, Viticulture, Wine","In this paper, we apply an agent-based approach to explain both the final state and the dynamics of the development process of the wine sector in the Małopolska region in Poland. This sector has been affected by various environmental, institutional, behavioural  and social factors and has undergone evolutionary changes in recent years. The econometric analysis of empirical data of vineyards in this region provides insights into the degree of influence of various factors under consideration on the aggregate number of vineyards in sub-regions. However,  this does no explain the dynamics of the local formation of new vineyards or the underlying latent attitudes of vineyard owners. To overcome this limitation, we developed an agent-based model with heterogeneous agents (regular farms as well as large and small vineyards), which allowed us to identify a two-stage development scenario: i) community building and ii) vineyard creation. Our findings are of two types. Firstly, we showed a case where the agent-based model has good predictive power, in situations where the econometric model fails. Secondly, estimation of the agent-based model parameters and sensitivity analysis revealed crucial factors that have driven development of viticulture in the Małopolska region. In particular, we find that the crucial element underlying the good predictive power of the model is that it enables us to capture the fact that wine enthusiasts initially concentrate  in sub-regions with more benign environmental conditions. Next, when one of them eventually established a vineyard, agents in the community had a lowered barrier to entry via the possibility of practical knowledge exchange, joint marketing efforts or vineyard maintenance resource sharing. This is in line with current evidence, which shows strong clustering effects, namely, a relatively large number of vineyards originate at relatively similar times and locations."
An Agent-Based Model of Residential Energy Efficiency Adoption,"Magnus Moglia, Aneta Podkalicka and James McGregor","Energy Efficiency, Policy Assessment, Innovation Diffusion, Solar Hot Water, Consumat, Ex-Ante","This paper reports on an Agent-Based Model. The purpose of developing this model is to describe ‘the uptake of low carbon and energy efficient technologies and practices by households and under different interventions’. There is a particular focus on modelling non-financial incentives as well as the influence of social networks as well as the decision making by multiple types of agents in interaction, i.e. recommending agents and sales agents, not just households. The decision making model for householder agents is inspired by the Consumat approach, as well as some of those recently applied to electric vehicles. A feature that differentiates this model is that it also represents information agents that provide recommendations and sales agents that proactively sell energy efficient products.  By applying the model to a number of scenarios with policies aimed at increasing the adoption of solar hot water systems, a range of questions are explored, including whether it is more effective to incentivise sales agents to promote solar hot water systems, or whether it is more effective to provide a subsidy directly to households; or in fact whether it is better to work with plumbers so that they can promote these systems. The resultant model should be viewed as a conceptual structure with a theoretical and empirical grounding, but which requires further data collection for rigorous analysis of policy options."
Mamdani Fuzzy Systems for Modelling and Simulation: A Critical Assessment,Segismundo S. Izquierdo and Luis R. Izquierdo,"Social Simulation, Decision Support Systems, Deductive Inference, Fuzzy Logic, Mamdani","Fuzzy logic presents many potential applications for modelling and simulation. In particular, this paper analyses one of the most popular fuzzy logic techniques: Mamdani systems. Mamdani systems can look particularly appealing because they are designed to incorporate expert knowledge in the form of IF-THEN rules expressed in natural language. While this is an attractive feature for modelling and simulating social and other complex systems, its actual application presents important caveats. This paper studies the potential use of Mamdani systems to explore the logical consequences of a model based on IF-THEN rules via simulation. We show that in the best-case scenario a Mamdani system provides a function that complies with its generating set of IF-THEN rules, which is a different exercise from that of finding the relation or consequences implied by those rules. In general, the logical consequences of a set of rules cannot be captured by a single function. Furthermore, the consequences of an IF-THEN rule in a Mamdani system can be very different from the consequences of that same rule in a system governed by the most basic principles of logical deductive inference. Thus, care must be taken when applying this tool to study “the consequences” of a set of hypothesis. Previous analyses have typically focused on particular steps of the Mamdani process, while here we present a holistic assessment of this technique for (deductive) simulation purposes."
Streamlining Simulation Experiments with Agent-Based Models in Demography,"Oliver Reinhardt, Jason Hilton, Tom Warnke, Jakub Bijak and Adelinde M. Uhrmacher","Agent-Based Modeling, Demography, Simulation Experimentation, Meta-Modeling","In the last decade, the uptake of agent-based modeling in demography and other population sciences has been slowly increasing. Still, in such areas, where traditional data-driven, statistical approaches prevail, the hypothesis-driven design of agent-based models leads to questioning the validity of these models. Consequently, suitable means to increase the confidence into models and simulation results are required. To that end, explicit, replicable simulation experiments play a central role in model design and validation. However, the analysis of more complex models implies executing various experiments, each of which combines various methods. To streamline these experimentation processes a flexible computational simulation environment is necessary. With a new binding between SESSL -- an internal domain-specific language for simulation experiments -- and ML3 -- a simulator for linked lives designed specifically for agent-based demographic models -- we cater for these objectives and provide a powerful simulation tool. The proposed approach can serve as a foundation for current efforts of employing advanced and statistical model analysis of agent-based demographic models, as part of a wider process of iterative model building. We demonstrate its potential in specifying and executing different experiments with a simple model of return migration and a more complex model of social care."
Emergence of Task Formation in Organizations: Balancing Units' Competence and Capacity,Friederike Wall,"Agent-Based Simulation, Complexity, Coordination, Emergence, Reinforcement Learning, Task Formation","This paper studies the emergence of task formation under conditions of limited knowledge about the  complexity of the problem to be solved by an organization. Task formation is a key issue in organizational theory and the emergence of task formation is of particular interest when the complexity of the overall problem to be solved is not known in advance, since, for example, an organization is newly founded or has gone through an external shock. The paper employs an agent-based simulation based on the framework of NK fitness landscapes and controls for different levels of task complexity and for different coordination modes. In the simulations, artificial organizations are observed while searching for higher levels of organizational performance by two intertwined adaptive processes: short-termed search for superior solutions to the organizations'  task and, in mid term, learning-based adaptation of task formation. The results suggest that the emerging task formations vary with the complexity of the underlying problem and, thereby, the balance between units' scope of competence and the organizational capacity for problem-solving is affected. For decomposable problems, task formations emerge which reflect the nature of the underlying problem; for non-decomposable structures, task formations with a broader scope of units' competence emerge. Furthermore, results indicate that, particularly for non-decomposable problems, the coordination mode employed in an organization subtly interferes with the emergence of task formation."
Model of Knowledge Transfer Within an Organisation,"Agnieszka Kowalska-Styczeń, Krzysztof Malarz and Kamil Paradowski","Knowledge Transfer, Complex Systems, Organisations as Complex Systems, Cellular Automata","Many studies show that the acquisition of knowledge is the key to build competitive advantage of companies. We propose a simple model of knowledge transfer within the organisation and we implement the proposed model using cellular automata technique. In this paper the organisation is considered in the context of complex systems. In this perspective, the main role in organisation is played by the network of informal contacts (informal communication). The goal of this paper is to check which factors influence the efficiency and effectiveness of knowledge transfer. Our studies indicate a significant role of initial distribution of chunks of knowledge for knowledge transfer process, and the results suggest taking action in the organisation to shorten the distance (social distance) between people with different levels of knowledge, or working out incentives to share knowledge."
Emotion Modeling in Social Simulation: A Survey,"Mathieu Bourgais, Patrick Taillandier, Laurent Vercouter and Carole Adam","Emotion, Social Simulation, Survey","Emotions play a key role in human behavior. Being able to integrate them in models is thus a major issue to improve the believability of agent-based social simulations. However, even though these last years have seen the emergence of many emotional models usable for simulations, many modelers still tend to use simple ad hoc emotional models. To support this view, this article proposes a survey of the different practices of modelers in terms of implementations of emotional models. We then present different emotional architectures that already exist and that can be used by modelers. The main goal is to understand the way emotions are used today in social simulations, in order for the community to unify its uses of emotional agents."
PyNetLogo: Linking NetLogo with Python,Marc Jaxa-Rozen and Jan H. Kwakkel,"Agent-Based Modelling, NetLogo, Python","Methods for testing and analyzing agent-based models have drawn increasing attention in the literature, in the context of efforts to establish standard frameworks for the development and documentation of models. This process can benefit from the use of established software environments for data analysis and visualization. For instance, the popular NetLogo agent-based modelling software can be interfaced with Mathematica and R, letting modellers use the advanced analysis capabilities available in these programming languages. To extend these capabilities to an additional user base, this paper presents the pyNetLogo connector, which allows NetLogo to be controlled from the Python general-purpose programming language. Given Python’s increasing popularity for scientific computing, this provides additional flexibility for modellers and analysts. PyNetLogo’s features are demonstrated by controlling one of NetLogo’s example models from an interactive Python environment, then performing a global sensitivity analysis with parallel processing."
Simulating  the Impacts of Climate Variability and Change on Crop Varietal Diversity in Mali (West-Africa) Using Agent-Based Modeling Approach,"Mahamadou Belem, Didier Bazile and Harouna Coulibaly","Participatory Modelling, Climate Change, Adaptation, Agrobiodiversity, Mali","This paper presents a generic, agent-based model that simulates the dynamics of crop varietal diversity at the village level in Mali under different socio-economic, environmental and policy scenarios. The model is designed to integrate social, economic, environmental, and policy factors . A participatory approach with scientists, farmers and policy makers has been implemented to achieve this goal. This approach combines role playing  games with agent-based modelling.  A set of scenarios are elaborated to evaluate the possible impacts of policy interventions and climate change on agrobiodiversity dynamics. Simulations showed how farmers manage crop varietal diversity to cope with the local climate variability for their annual crop production. The portfolio of varieties increases under stable and good climate condition and decrease under less favourable and variable climate conditions.  In addition, depending on the climate condition, farmers allocate preferentially land to varieties with higher yields."
Simulation of the Governance of Complex Systems (SimCo):  Basic Concepts and Experiments on Urban Transportation,"Fabian Adelt, Johannes Weyer, Sebastian Hoffmann and Andreas Ihrig","Governance, Agent-Based Modelling, Complexity, Infrastructure Systems, Transport Network, Transport Mode Choice","The current paper is positioned at the intersection of computer simulation, governance research, and research on infrastructure systems, such as transportation or energy. It proposes a simulation framework, “Simulation of the governance of complex systems” (SimCo), to study the governability of complex socio-technical systems experimentally by means of agent-based modelling (ABM). SimCo is rooted in a sociological macro-micro-macro model of a socio-technical system, taking into account the interplay of agents' choices (micro) and situational constraints (macro). The paper presents the conceptualization of SimCo, its elements and subsystems as well as their interactions. SimCo depicts the daily routines of users performing their tasks (e.g. going to work) by choosing among different technologies (e.g. modes of transportation), occasionally deciding to replace a worn-out technology. All components entail different dimensions that can be adjusted, thus allowing operators to purposefully intervene, for instance in the case of risk management (e.g. preventing congestion) or system transformation (e.g. towards sustainable mobility). Experiments with a basic scenario of an urban road transport system demonstrate the effects of different modes of governance (soft control, strong control and a combination of both), revealing that soft control may be the best strategy to govern a complex socio-technical system."
The Thin Blue Line Between Protesters and Their Counter-Protesters,Tamsin E. Lee,"Agent-Based Modelling, Individual-Based Model, Protest Behaviour, Social Simulation, Netlogo","More frequently protests are accompanied by an opposing group performing a counter protest. This phenomenon can increase tension such that police must try to keep the two groups separated. However, what is the best strategy for police? This paper uses a simple agent-based model to determine the best strategy for keeping the two groups separated. The 'thin blue line' varies in density (number of police), width and the keenness of police to approach protesters. Three different groups of protesters are modelled to mimic peaceful, average and volatile protests. In most cases, a few police forming a single-file 'thin blue line' separating the groups is very effective. However, when the protests are more volatile, it is more effective to have many police occupying a wide 'thin blue line', and police being keen to approach protesters. To the authors knowledge, this is the first paper to model protests and counter-protests."
Evolution of Government’s Performance Through Yardstick Competition in the Spatial Game of Gubernatorial Elections,Tanzhe Tang and Ke Zeng,"Yardstick Competition, Gubernatorial Election, Electoral Simulation, Political Economy","Yardstick Competition is a unique feature of gubernatorial elections and may have a paramount role in the development of democracy and local government’s performance. This paper investigates the behaviours of governors and voters in an evolutionary game of gubernatorial election by introducing the spatial simulation process where voters can make comparisons between the incumbent and neighboring politicians. Based on the model, we portray the evolutionary process and topologies of local governments’ performances in federal systems. In the baseline model, we find that the variance of governor candidates’ performances, as well as the intensity of the yardstick competition, are positively related to the overall performance of governments. To study the relationship between elections and foreign policies, we employ an evolutionary Public Good Game in which governors can affect the welfare of neighbours by determining whether to invest in cross-provincial constructions. In the extended simulations where governors and voters are assigned to various characters, we find that asymmetry between candidates’ potentials and voters’ perception increases the uncertainty of the electoral results, and selfless voters will lead to lower performances of governments."
ODD+2D: An ODD Based Protocol for Mapping Data to Empirical ABMs,"Ahmed Laatabi, Nicolas Marilleau, Tri Nguyen-Huu, Hassan Hbid and Mohamed Ait Babram","Empirical Agent-Based Models, ODD Protocol, ODD+2D, Mapping, Data Analysis, Social Simulation","The quantity of data and processes used in modeling projects has been dramatically increasing in recent years due to the progress in computation capability and to the popularity of new approaches such as open data. Modelers face an increasing difficulty in analyzing and modeling complex systems that consist of many heterogeneous entities. Adapting existing models is relevant to avoid dealing with the complexity of writing and studying a new model from scratch. ODD (Overview, Design concepts, Details) protocol has emerged as a solution to document Agent-Based Models (ABMs). It appears to be a convenient solution to address significant problems such as comprehension, replication, and dissemination. However, it lacks a standard that formalizes the use of data in empirical models. This paper tackles this issue by proposing a set of rules that outline the use of empirical data inside an ABM. We call this new protocol ODD+2D (ODD+Decision + Data). ODD+2D integrates a mapping diagram called DAMap (Data to Agent Mapping). This mapping model formalizes how data are processed and mapped to agent-based models. In this paper, we focus on the architecture of ODD+2D, and we illustrate it with a residential mobility model in Marrakesh."
Dynamic Pricing Strategies for Perishable Product in a Competitive Multi-Agent Retailers Market,"Wenchong Chen, Hongwei Liu and Dan Xu","Dynamic Pricing Strategies, Customer Preference, Perishable Product, Multi-Agent, Q-Learning Algorithm","Due to the fierce competition in the marketplace for perishable products, retailers have to use pricing strategies to attract customers. Traditional pricing strategies adjust products’ prices according to retailers’ current situations (e.g. Cost-plus pricing strategy, Value-based pricing strategy and Inventory-sensitive pricing strategy). However, many retailers lack the perception for customer preferences and an understanding of the competitive environment. This paper explores a price Q-learning mechanism for perishable products that considers uncertain demand and customer preferences in a competitive multi-agent retailer market (a model-free environment). In the proposed simulation model, agents imitate the behavior of consumers and retailers. Four potential influencing factors (competition, customer preferences, uncertain demand, perishable characteristics) are constructed in the pricing decisions. All retailer agents adjust their products’ prices over a finite sales horizon to maximize expected revenues. A retailer agent adjusts its price according to the Q-learning mechanism, while others adapt traditional pricing strategies. Shortage is allowed while backlog is not. The simulation results show that the dynamic pricing strategy via the Q-learning mechanism can be used for pricing perishable products in a competitive environment, as it can produce more revenue for retailers. Further, the paper investigates how an optimal pricing strategy is influenced by customer preferences, customer demand, retailer pricing parameters and the learning parameters of Q-learning. Based on our results, we provide pricing implications for retailers pursuing higher revenues."
Forecasting Changes in Religiosity and Existential Security with an Agent-Based Model,"Ross Gore, Carlos Lemos, F. LeRon Shults and Wesley J. Wildman","Religion, Agent-Based Model, Data Based Modeling, Social Influence","We employ existing data sets and agent-based modeling to forecast changes in religiosity and existential security among a collective of individuals over time. Existential security reflects the extent of economic, socioeconomic and human development provided by society. Our model includes agents in social networks interacting with one another based on the education level of the agents, the religious practices of the agents, and each agent's existential security within their natural and social environments. The data used to inform the values and relationships among these variables is based on rigorous statistical analysis of the International Social Survey Programme Religion Module (ISSP) and the Human Development Report (HDR). We conduct an evaluation that demonstrates, for the countries and time periods studied, that our model provides a more accurate forecast of changes in existential security and religiosity than two alternative approaches. The improved accuracy is largely due to the inclusion of social networks with educational homophily which alters the way in which religiosity and existential security change in the model. These dynamics grow societies where two individuals with the same initial religious practices (or belief In God, or supernatural beliefs) evolve differently based on the educational backgrounds of the individuals with which they surround themselves. Finally, we discuss the limitations of our model and provide direction for future work."
Comparing Prediction Market Mechanisms:  An Experiment-Based and Micro Validated Multi-Agent Simulation,Frank M. A. Klingert and Matthias Meyer,"Continuous Double Auction, Logarithmic Market Scoring Rule, Market Mechanisms, Multi-Agent Simulation, Prediction Markets, Simulation Validation","Prediction markets are a promising instrument for drawing on the “wisdom of the crowds”. For instance, in a corporate context they have been used successfully to forecast sales or project risks by tapping into the heterogeneous information of decentralized actors in and outside of companies. Among the main market mechanisms implemented so far in prediction markets are (1) the continuous double auction and (2) the logarithmic market scoring rule. However, it is not fully understood how this choice affects crucial variables like prediction market accuracy or price variation. Our paper uses an experiment-based and micro validated simulation model to improve the understanding of the mechanism-related effects and to inform further laboratory experiments. The results underline the impact of mechanism selection. Due to the higher number of trades and the lower standard deviation of the price, the logarithmic market scoring rule seems to have a clear advantage at a first glance. This changes when the accuracy level, which is the most important criterion from a practical perspective, is used as an independent variable; the effects become less straightforward and depend on the environment and actors. Besides these contributions, this work provides an example of how experimental data can be used to validate agent strategies on the micro level using statistical methods."
Agent-Based Modelling to Assess Community Food Security and Sustainable Livelihoods,"Samantha Dobbie, Kate Schreckenberg, James G Dyke, Marije Schaafsma and Stefano Balbi","Social-Ecological Systems, Livelihood Trajectories, Nutrition, Malawi, Food Security","We present a methodological approach for constructing an ABM to assess community food security and variation among livelihood trajectories, using rural Malawi as a case study. The approach integrates both quantitative and qualitative data to explore how interactions between households and the environment lead to the emergence of community food availability, access, utilisation and stability over time. Results suggest that livelihoods based upon either non-agricultural work or farming are most stable over time, but agricultural labourers, dependent upon the availability of casual work, demonstrate limited capacity to ‘step-up’ livelihood activities. The scenario results suggest that population growth and increased rainfall variability are linked to significant declines in food utilisation and stability by 2050. Taking a systems approach may help to enhance the sustainability of livelihoods, target efforts and promote community food security. We discuss transferability of the methodological approach to other case studies and scenarios."
The Role of Heterogeneity and the Dynamics of Voluntary Contributions to Public Goods: An Experimental and Agent-Based Simulation Analysis,"Engi Amin, Mohamed Abouelela and Amal Soliman","Agent-Based Simulation, Cooperation, Public Goods Game, Laboratory Experiment, Social Preferences",This paper examines the role of heterogeneous agents in the study of voluntary contributions to public goods. A human-subject experiment was conducted to classify agent types and determine their effects on contribution levels. Data from the experiment was used to build and calibrate an agent-based simulation model. The simulations display how different compositions of agent preference types affect the contribution levels. Findings indicate that the heterogeneity of cooperative preferences is an important determinant of a population’s contribution pattern.
Social Norms and the Dominance of Low-Doers,Carlo Proietti and Antonio Franco,"Agent-Based Model, Social Norms, Game Theory","Social norms play a fundamental role in holding groups together. The rationale behind most of them is to coordinate individual actions into a beneficial societal outcome. However, there are cases where pro-social behavior within a community seems, to the contrary, to cause inefficiencies and suboptimal collective outcomes. An explanation for this is that individuals in a society are of different types and their type determines the norm of fairness they adopt. Not all such norms are bound to be beneficial at the societal level. When individuals of different types meet a clash of norms can arise. This, in turn, can determine an advantage for the “wrong” type. We show this by a game-theoretic analysis in a very simple setting. To test this result - as well as its possible remedies - we also devise a specific simulation model.

Which Perspective of Institutional Change Best Fits Empirical Data? An Agent-Based Model Comparison of Rational Choice and Cultural Diffusion in Invasive Plant Management,"Abigail Sullivan, Li An and Abigail York","Agent-Based Model, Institutions, Invasive Pest, Collective Action","There are multiple theories regarding how institutions change over time, but institutional change is often difficult to study and understand in practice. Agent-based modeling is known as a technique to explore emergent phenomena resulting from the micro level activities and interactions between heterogeneous agents and between agents and the environment. Such models allow researchers to investigate theories which may otherwise be difficult to examine. We present a theoretically driven agent-based model to explore two perspectives on institutional change, rational choice and cultural diffusion, in the context of invasive plant management in Chitwan, Nepal. The Chitwan region is grappling with the spread of the invasive mile-a-minute weed, Mikania micrantha (Mikania). We focus on understanding which perspective of institutional change better fits empirical survey data on Mikania management. We find that rational choice is an unlikely candidate for institutional change in Chitwan and that the social learning and imitation mechanism modeled in the cultural diffusion perspective better replicates empirical patterns. Additionally, the model reveals that the percentage of agents adopting the best practice removal method is not as influential in reducing Mikania as the initial amount of Mikania removed. This result indicates that it may be useful to conduct an empirical assessment varying the initial amount of Mikania removed to understand the management implications for successful removal of Mikania in Chitwan and elsewhere."
Examining  Collusion and Voting Biases Between Countries During the Eurovision Song Contest Since 1957,"Alexander V. Mantzaris, Samuel R. Rein and Alexander D. Hopkins","Simulation, Eurovision Song Contest, Voting Blocs, Sampling Schemes, JuliaLang","The Eurovision Song Contest (ESC) is an annual event which attracts millions of viewers. It is an interesting activity to examine since the participants of the competition represent a particular country's  musical performance that will be awarded a set of scores from other participating countries based upon a quality assessment of a performance. There is a question of whether the countries will vote exclusively according to the artistic merit of the song, or if the vote will be a public signal of national support for another country. Since the competition aims to bring people together, any consistent biases in the awarding of scores would defeat the purpose of the celebration of expression and this  has attracted researchers to investigate the supporting evidence for biases. This paper builds upon an approach which produces a set of random samples from an unbiased distribution of score allocation, and extends the methodology to use the full set of years of the competition's life span which has seen fundamental changes to the voting schemes adopted. By building up networks from statistically significant edge sets of vote allocations during a set of years, the results display a plausible network for the origins of the culture anchors for the preferences of the awarded votes. With 60 years of data, the results support the hypothesis of regional collusion and biases arising from  proximity, culture and other irrelevant factors in regards to the music which that alone is intended to affect the judgment of the contest."
Integrating Global Sensitivity Approaches to Deconstruct Spatial and Temporal Sensitivities of Complex Spatial Agent-Based Models,"Nicholas Magliocca, Virginia McConnell and Margaret Walls","Global Sensitivity Analysis, Variance Decomposition, Time-Varying Sensitivity Analysis, Spatial Uncertainty, Coastal Hazards","Spatial agent-based models (ABMs) can be powerful tools for understanding individual level decision-making. However, in an attempt to represent realistic decision-making processes, spatial ABMs often become extremely complex, making it difficult to identify and quantify sources of model sensitivity. This paper implements a coastal version of the economic agent-based urban growth model, CHALMS, to investigate both space- and time-varying sensitivities of simulated coastal development dynamics. We review the current state of spatially- and temporally-explicit global sensitivity analyses (GSA) for environmental modeling in general, and build on the innovative but nascent efforts to implement these approaches with complex spatial ABMs. Combined variance- and density-based approaches to GSA were used to investigate the partitioning, magnitude, and directionality of model output variance. Time-varying GSA revealed sensitivity of multiple outputs to storm frequency and cyclical patterns of sensitivity for other input parameters. Spatially-explicit GSA showed diverging sensitivities at landscape versus (smaller-scale) zonal levels, reflecting trade-offs in residential housing consumer location decisions and spatial ‘spill-over’ interactions. More broadly, when transitioning from a conceptual to empirically parameterized model, sensitivity analysis is a helpful step to prioritize parameters for data collection, particularly when data collection is costly. These findings illustrate unique challenges of and need to perform comprehensive sensitivity analysis with dynamic, spatial ABMs."
Random-Subset Voting,"Guilherme Barros Correa de Amorim, Ana Paula Cabral Seixas Costa, Danielle Costa Morais and Leandro Chaves Rego","Decision Theory, Voting Procedure, Random Subsets, Borda, Bounded Rationality","Most of the voting procedures in the literature assume that voters have complete and transitive preferences over the alternatives. A basic premise is that any voter is able to evaluate any pair of alternatives in a set and select his/her preferred one, or indicate indifference between them. Nevertheless, some researchers have highlighted that voters, as humans, have limited capacity to deal with and consequently compare big sets of alternatives. In this paper, we propose the Random-Subset Voting, a voting procedure that through a random approach allows the voters to evaluate less alternatives. Instead of analyzing the entire set of alternatives, each voter will evaluate a random subset of a pre-determined size. We have proposed a theorem indicating that, for large sets of voters, the outcomes of traditional Borda and Random-Subset Borda converge. We have also implemented a web experiment and a Monte Carlo simulation in order to validate the proposed procedure and analyze how it behaves in several scenarios."
A Minimal Agent-Based Model Reproduces the Overall Topology of Interbank Networks,"Sara Cuenda, Maximiliano Fernández, Javier Galeano and José A. Capitán","Interbank Markets, Agent-Based Modeling, Complex Networks","The description of the empirical structure of interbank networks constitutes an important field of study since network theory can be used as a powerful tool to assess the resilience of financial systems and their robustness against failures. On the other hand, the development of reliable models of interbank market structure is relevant as they can be used to analyze systemic risk in the absence of transaction data or to test statistical hypotheses regarding network properties. Based on a detailed data-driven analysis of bank positions (assets and liabilities) taken from the Bankscope database, we here develop a minimal, stochastic, agent-based network model that accounts for the basic topology of interbank networks reported in the literature. The main assumption of our model is that loans between banks attempt to compensate assets and liabilities at each time step, and the model renders networks comparable with those observed in empirical studies. In particular, our model is able to qualitatively reproduce degree distributions, the distribution of the number of transactions, the distribution of exposures, the correlations with nearest-neighbor out-degree, and the clustering coefficient. As our simple model captures the overall structure of empirical networks, it can thus be used as a null model for testing hypotheses relative to other specific properties of interbank networks."
Modelling Sustainability Transitions: An Assessment of Approaches and Challenges,"Jonathan Köhler, Fjalar de Haan, Georg Holtz, Klaus Kubeczko, Enayat Moallemi, George Papachristos and Emile Chappin","Transitions Models, Qualitative System Change, Modelling Social Values and Norms, Behavioural Change","Transition modelling is an emerging but growing niche within the broader field of sustainability transitions research. The objective of this paper is to explore the characteristics of this niche in relation to a range of existing modelling approaches and literatures with which it shares commonalities or from which it could draw. We distil a number of key aspects we think a transitions model should be able to address, from a broadly acknowledged, empirical list of transition characteristics. We review some of the main strands in modelling of socio-technological change with regards to their ability to address these characteristics. These are: Eco-innovation literatures (energy-economy models and Integrated Assessment Models), evolutionary economics, complex systems models, computational social science simulations using agent based models, system dynamics models and socio-ecological systems models. The modelling approaches reviewed can address many of the features that differentiate sustainability transitions from other socio-economic dynamics or innovations. The most problematic features are the representation of qualitatively different system states and of the normative aspects of change. The comparison provides transition researchers with a starting point for their choice of a modelling approach, whose characteristics should correspond to the characteristics of the research question they face. A promising line of research is to develop innovative models of co-evolution of behaviours and technologies towards sustainability, involving change in the structure of the societal and technical systems."
Computational Modelling of Public Policy: Reflections on Practice,"Nigel Gilbert, Petra Ahrweiler, Pete Barbrook-Johnson, Kavin Preethi Narasimhan and Helen Wilkinson","Policy Modelling, Policy Evaluation, Policy Appraisal, Modelling Guidelines, Collaboration, Ethics","Computational models are increasingly being used to assist in developing, implementing and evaluating public policy. This paper reports on the experience of the authors in designing and using computational models of public policy (‘policy models’, for short). The paper considers the role of computational models in policy making, and some of the challenges that need to be overcome if policy models are to make an effective contribution.  It suggests that policy models can have an important place in the policy process because they could allow policy makers to experiment in a virtual world, and have many advantages compared with randomised control trials and policy pilots. The paper then summarises some general lessons that can be extracted from the authors’ experience with policy modelling.  These general lessons include the observation that often the main benefit of designing and using a model is that it provides an understanding of the policy domain, rather than the numbers it generates; that care needs to be taken that models are designed at an appropriate level of abstraction; that although appropriate data for calibration and validation may sometimes be in short supply, modelling is often still valuable; that modelling collaboratively and involving a range of stakeholders from the outset increases the likelihood that the model will be used and will be fit for purpose; that attention needs to be paid to effective communication between modellers and stakeholders; and that modelling for public policy involves ethical issues that need careful consideration. The paper concludes that policy modelling will continue to grow in importance as a component of public policy making processes, but if its potential is to be fully realised, there will need to be a melding of the cultures of computational modelling and policy making."
Models of Social Influence: Towards the Next Frontiers,"Andreas Flache, Michael Mäs, Thomas Feliciani, Edmund Chattoe-Brown, Guillaume Deffuant, Sylvie Huet and Jan Lorenz","Social Influence, Opinion Dynamics, Polarization, Calibration and Validation, Micro-Macro Link","In 1997, Robert Axelrod wondered in a highly influential paper “If people tend to become more alike in their beliefs, attitudes, and behavior when they interact, why do not all such differences eventually disappear?” Axelrod’s question highlighted an ongoing quest for formal theoretical answers joined by researchers from a wide range of disciplines. Numerous models have been developed to understand why and under what conditions diversity in beliefs, attitudes and behavior can co-exist with the fact that very often in interactions, social influence reduces differences between people. Reviewing three prominent approaches, we discuss the theoretical ingredients that researchers added to classic models of social influence as well as their implications. Then, we propose two main frontiers for future research. First, there is urgent need for more theoretical work comparing, relating and integrating alternative models. Second, the field suffers from a strong imbalance between a proliferation of theoretical studies and a dearth of empirical work. More empirical work is needed testing and underpinning micro-level assumptions about social influence as well as macro-level predictions. In conclusion, we discuss major roadblocks that need to be overcome to achieve progress on each frontier. We also propose that a new generation of empirically-based computational social influence models can make unique contributions for understanding key societal challenges, like the possible effects of social media on societal polarization."
Opinion Communication on Contested Topics: How Empirics and Arguments can Improve Social Simulation,Annalisa Stefanelli and Roman Seidl,"Agent-Based Model, Arguments, Opinion Dynamics, Social Judgment","The effect of social interactions on how opinions are developed and changed over time is crucial to public processes that involve citizens and their points of view. In this opinion dynamics exercise, we address the topic of nuclear waste repositories in Switzerland and suggest a more realistic investigation of public opinion using agent-based modeling in combination with empirical data and  sociopsychological theory. Empirical data obtained from an online questionnaire (N = 841) is used for the initialization of the model, whose agents directly represent the participants. We use social judgment theory (SJT) to describe how opinions can be adapted during social interactions, including through mechanisms of contrast and assimilation. Furthermore, we focus on the definition of “opinion” itself, claiming that working with disaggregated opinions (i.e., arguments) can play a determining role if one aims to capture real-world mechanisms of opinion dynamics. Simulation results show different patterns for the three different argument categories used for this specific topic (i.e., risk, benefit, and process), suggesting a mutual influence between an individual’s initial knowledge and evaluations and an individual’s social dynamics and opinion changes. The importance of content-related and empirical information, as well as the theory and mechanisms used in the social simulation, are discussed."
Cooperation Via Intimidation: An Emergent System of Mutual Threats can Maintain Social Order,Piotr Mateusz Patrzyk and Martin Takáč,"Cooperation, Punishment, Revenge, Conflict, Aggression, Morality","Can human aggressiveness promote peaceful cooperation? Despite the seeming contradiction of these phenomena, our study suggests the answer is yes. We develop two agent-based models of cooperative interactions among aggressive agents threatening each other. In Model 1, we show that aggressive displays performed by dominance-seeking individuals create a system of mutual threats that effectively enforces cooperation and inhibits agents from escalating conflicts. This happens because agents observe each other fighting, which deters them from attacking each other due to aggressive reputations. In Model 2 we extend this effect to third-party interventions showing that forming alliances makes attacks more efficient and promotes the emergence of common rules determining whom to fight against. In such a state, social order is maintained by the existence of moral alliances – groups of agents willing to fight against norm violators. In summary, we argue that reputation for toughness and the aggressive predisposition of humans could have played an important role in the evolution of cooperation and moral systems."
A Model-Based Analysis of the Minimum Size of Demographically-Viable Hunter-Gatherer Populations,Andrew White,"Hunter-Gatherer, Demography, Demographic Viability, Mortality, Fertility, Polygyny","A non-spatial agent-based model is used to explore how marriage behaviors and fertility affect the minimum population size required for hunter-gatherer systems to be demographically viable.  The model incorporates representations of person- and household-level constraints and behaviors affecting marriage, reproduction, and mortality.  Results suggest that, under a variety of circumstances, a stable population size of about 150 persons is demographically viable in the sense that it is largely immune from extinction through normal stochastic perturbations in mortality, fertility, and sex ratio.  Less restrictive marriage rules enhance the viability of small populations by making it possible to capitalize on a greater proportion of the finite female reproductive span and compensate for random fluctuations in the balance of males and females."
Violent and Non-Violent Strategies of Counterinsurgency,Anna O. Pechenkina and D. Scott Bennett,"Counterinsurgency, Insurgency, Attrition, Military Approach, Hearts and Minds, Aid","Responses to insurgency include both a large-scale societal reform directed at improving the lives of civilians and a direct military response with no additional programs to improve civilian welfare. In this paper, we ask, what is the optimal combination of aid and military response from the viewpoint of the state? Using a computational model, we evaluate what mix of these two strategies helps the government defeat an insurgency more quickly. Our model yields that aid may boost a military strategy that avoids civilian casualties, but it may not compensate for a military strategy that targets civilians indiscriminately."
Introducing a Multi-Asset Stock Market to Test the Power of Investor Networks,Matthew Oldham,"Agent-Based Model, Artificial Stock Market, Networks, Portfolio Anlaysis","The behavior of financial markets has frustrated, and continues to frustrate, investors and academics. By utilizing a complex systems framework, researchers have discovered new fields of investigations that have provided meaningful insight into the behavior of financial markets. The use of agent-based models (ABMs) and the inclusion of network science have played an important role in increasing the relevance of the complex systems to financial markets. The challenge of how best to combine these new techniques to produce meaningful results that can be accepted by the broader community remains an issue. By implementing an artificial stock market that utilizes an Ising model based agent-based model (ABM), this paper provides insights into the mechanisms that drive the returns in financial markets, including periods of elevated prices and excess volatility. A key finding is that the network topology investors form significantly affects the behavior of the market, with the exception being if investors have a bias to following their neighbors, at which point the topology becomes redundant. The model also investigates the impact of introducing multiple risky assets, something that has been absent in previous attempts. By successfully addressing these issues this paper helps to refine and shape a variety of further research tasks for the use of ABMs in uncovering the dynamics of financial markets."
A Computational Study of the Station Nightclub Fire Accounting for Social Relationships,"Sherif El-Tawil, Jieshi Fang, Benigno Aguirre and Eric Best","Egress, Agent-Based Model, Scalar Field Method, Social Relationships, the Station Building Fire","Using agent based modeling, this study presents the results of a computational study of social relationships among more than four hundreds evacuees in The Station Nightclub building in Rhode Island. The fire occurred on the night of February 20, 2003 and resulted in 100 fatalities. After summarizing and calibrating the computational method used, parametric studies are conducted to quantitatively investigate the influences of the presence of social relationships and familiarity of the building floor plan on the death and injury tolls. It is demonstrated that the proposed model has the ability to reasonably handle the complex social relationships and group behaviors present during egress. The simulations quantify how intimate social affiliations delay the overall egress process and show the extent by which lack of knowledge of a building floor plan limits exit choices and adversely affects the number of safe evacuations."
R&D Subsidization Effect and Network Centralization:  Evidence from an Agent-Based Micro-Policy Simulation,"Pierpaolo Angelini, Giovanni Cerulli, Federico Cecconi, Maria-Augusta Miceli and Bianca Potì","R&D Policy, Networks, Complexity, Social Simulation","This paper presents an agent-based micro-policy simulation model assessing public R&D policy effect when R&D and non-R&D performing companies are located within a network. We set out by illustrating the behavioural structure and the computational logic of the proposed model; then, we provide a simulation experiment where the pattern of the total level of R&D activated by a fixed amount of public support is analysed as function of companies’ network topology. More specifically, the suggested simulation experiment shows that a larger “hubness” of the network is more likely accompanied with a decreasing median of the aggregated total R&D performance of the system. Since the aggregated firm idiosyncratic R&D (i.e., the part of total R&D independent of spillovers) is slightly increasing, we conclude that positive cross-firm spillover effects - in the presence of a given amount of support - have a sizeable impact within less centralized networks, where fewer hubs emerge. This may question the common wisdom suggesting that larger R&D externality effects should be more likely to arise when few central champions receive a support."
Asynchronous Opinion Dynamics with Online and Offline Interactions in Bounded Confidence Model,"Zhaogang Ding, Yucheng Dong, Haiming Liang and Francisco Chiclana","Opinion Dynamics, Asynchronism, Bounded Confidence, Agent-Based Simulation","Nowadays, about half of the world population can receive information and exchange opinions in online environments (e.g. the Internet), while the other half do so offline (e.g. face to face). The speed at which information is received and opinions are exchanged in online environment is much faster than offline. To model this phenomenon, in this paper we consider online and offline as two subsystems in opinion dynamics and assume asynchronization when agents in these two subsystems update their opinions. We unfold that asynchronization has a strong impact on the steady-state time of the opinion dynamics, the opinion clusters and the interactions between online and offline subsystems. Furthermore, these effects are often enhanced the larger the size of the online subsystem is."
Direct and Indirect Economic Incentives to Mitigate Nitrogen Surpluses: A Sensitivity Analysis,"Alena Schmidt, Magdalena Necpalova, Albert Zimmermann, Stefan Mann, Johan Six and Gabriele Mack","Sensitivity Analysis, Full Factorial Design, Nitrogen Input Tax, Nitrogen Surplus, Swiss Agriculture","The reduction of nitrogen (N) surplus is an ongoing topic in the agri-environmental policies of many countries in the developed world. The introduction of N balance estimation in agricultural sector models is therefore pertinent and requires an interdisciplinary approach. We extended the agent based agricultural sector model SWISSland with an N farm gate balance estimation to pre-evaluate the introduction of a levy on N inputs, particularly a levy on fertilizer and imported concentrates, on N surplus reduction in the Swiss agriculture. The model was based on the Swiss farm accountancy data network (FADN) for 3,000 farms. The model’s ability to represent the N balance was assessed by conducting a structured full factorial sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis revealed the possibility to switch to organic farming and the hectare based payments for ensuring food security as key parameters with the largest influence on the modelled N surplus. The evaluation of N input levy scenarios suggested that an introduction of a tax of 800% of N price will reduce the N surplus by 10% indicating a price elasticity of -0.03. The sensitivity analysis and the results from the levy scenarios suggest that indirect instruments, such as optimizing the direct payments scheme, should be considered rather than direct instruments for an effective N surpluses mitigation in Swiss agriculture."
Efficient and Effective Pair-Matching Algorithms for Agent-Based Models,Nathan Geffen and Stefan Scholz,"HIV, Agent-Based Models, Sexually Transmitted Infections, Pair-Matching","Microsimulations and agent-based models across various disciplines need to match agents into relationships. Some of these models need to repeatedly match different pairs of agents, for example microsimulations of sexually transmitted infection epidemics. We describe the requirements for pair-matching in these types of microsimulations, and present several pair-matching algorithms: Brute force (BFPM), Random (RPM), Random k (RKPM), Weighted shuffle (WSPM), Cluster shuffle (CSPM), and Distribution counting (DCPM). Using two microsimulations, we empirically compare the speeds, and pairing quality of these six algorithms. For models which execute pair-matching many thousands or millions of times, BFPM is not usually a practical option because it is slow. On the other hand, RPM is fast but chooses poor quality pairs. Nevertheless both algorithms are used, sometimes implicitly, in many models. Here we use them as yardsticks for upper and lower bounds for speed and quality. In these tests CSPM offers the best trade-off of speed and effectiveness. In general, CSPM is fast and produces stochastic, high quality pair-matches, which are often desirable characteristics for pair-matching in discrete time step microsimulations. Moreover it is a simple algorithm that can be easily adapted for the specific needs of a particular domain. However, for some models, RKPM or DCPM would be as fast as CSPM with matches of similar quality. We discuss the circumstances under which this would happen."
Population Synthesis Based on Joint Distribution Inference Without Disaggregate Samples,"Peijun Ye, Xiaolin Hu, Yong Yuan and Fei-Yue Wang","Population Synthesis, Sample-Free, Iterative Proportional Fitting","Synthetic population is a fundamental input to dynamic micro-simulation in social applications. Based on the review of current major approaches, this paper presents a new sample-free synthesis method by inferring joint distribution of the total target population. Convergence of multivariate Iterative Proportional Fitting used in our method is also proved theoretically. The method, together with other existing ones, is applied to generate a nationwide synthetic population database of China by using its overall cross-classification tables as well as a sample from census. Marginal and partial joint distribution consistencies of each database are compared and evaluated quantitatively. Final results manifest sample-based methods have better performances on marginal indicators while the sample-free ones match partial distributions more precisely. Among the five methods, our proposed method significantly reduces the computational cost for generating synthetic population in large scale. An open source implementation of the population synthesizer based on C# used in this research is available at https://github.com/PeijunYe/PopulationSynthesis.git."
The Explanation of Social Conventions by Melioration Learning,Johannes Zschache,"Reinforcement Learning, Agent-Based Simulation, N-Way Coordination Game, Roth-Erev Model","In line with previous research, the evolution of social conventions is explored by n-way coordination games. A convention is said to be established if decisions of all actors synchronise over time. In contrast to the earlier studies, an empirically well-grounded process of reinforcement learning is used as behavioural assumption. The model is called melioration learning. It is shown by agent-based simulations that melioration enables  actors to establish a convention. Besides the payoffs of the coordination game, the network structure of interactions affects actors' ability to coordinate their choices and the speed of convergence. The results of melioration learning are compared to predictions of the Roth-Erev model."
Effects of the Interaction Between Ideological Affinity and Psychological Reaction of Agents on the Opinion Dynamics in a Relative Agreement Model,"Norma L. Abrica-Jacinto, Evguenii Kurmyshev and Héctor A. Juárez","Opinion Dynamics, Ideological Affinity, Artificial Society, Relative Agreement, Agent-Based Model","Ideology is one of the defining elements of opinion dynamics. In this paper, we report the effects of the nonlinear interaction of ideological affinity with the psychological reaction of agents in the frame of a multiparametric mathematical model of opinion dynamics. Computer simulations of artificial networked societies composed of agents of two psychological types were used for studying opinion formation; the simulations showed a phenomenon of preferential self-organization into groups of ideological affinity at the first stages of opinion evolution. The separation into ideologically akin opinion groups (ideological affinity) was more notable in societies composed mostly of concord agents; a larger opinion polarization was associated with the increase of agents’ initial average opinion uncertainty. We also observed a sensibility of opinion dynamics to the initial conditions of opinion and uncertainty, indicating potential instabilities. A measure of convergence was introduced to facilitate the analysis of transitions between the opinion states of networked societies and to detect social instability events. We found that the average of opinion uncertainty distribution reaches a steady state with values lower than the initial average value, sometimes nearing zero, which points at socially apathetic agents. Our analyses showed that the model can be utilized for further investigation on opinion dynamics and can be extended to other social phenomena."
The Role of Homophily in the Emergence of Opinion Controversies,Floriana Gargiulo and Yerali Gandica,"Opinion Controversies, Homophily, Network Communities, Media Pressure","Understanding the emergence of strong controversial issues in modern societies is a key issue in opinion studies. A commonly diffused idea is the fact that the increasing of homophily in social networks, due to the modern ICT, can be a driving force for opinion polariation. In this paper we address the problem with a modelling approach following three basic steps. We first introduce a network morphogenesis model to re-construct network structures where homophily can be tuned with a parameter. We show that as homophily increases the emergence of marked topological community structures in the networks raises. Secondly, we perform an opinion dynamics process on homophily dependent networks and we show that, contrary to the common idea, homophily helps consensus formation. Finally, we introduce a tunable external media pressure and we show that, actually, the combination of homophily and media makes the media effect less effective and leads to strongly polarized opinion clusters."
A Taxonomy for Agent-Based Models in Human Infectious Disease Epidemiology,"Elizabeth Hunter, Brian Mac Namee and John D. Kelleher","Agent-Based, Epidemiology, Infectious Disease, Simulation, Model, Taxonomy","Agent-based simulation modelling has been used in many epidemiological studies on infectious diseases. However, because agent based modelling is a field without any clear protocol for developing simulations the researcher is given a high amount of flexibility. This flexibility has led to many different forms of agent-based epidemiological simulations. In this paper we review the existing literature on agent-based epidemiological simulation models.  From our literature review we identify key similarities and differences in the exisiting simulations. We then use these similarities and differences to create a taxonomy of agent-based epidemiological models and show how the taxonomy can be used."
A Simulation of Entrepreneurial Spawning,Mark J. O. Bagley,"Industrial Clusters, Spin-Offs, Schumpeter, Evolutionary Economic Geography, Technological Change","This paper describes how patterns of industrial clustering arise with respect to the size of an initial firm when measured in terms of innovation. Through principles of evolutionary economics, the aim of this paper is to examine the ‘birth’ of industrial clusters. We take an endogenous and supply-side approach, where firms in a region spawn from incumbents. Technology is qualitatively described using a code set mapped on a cognitive space. Assuming inheritability of networking skills, we seek to model how the size of an initial firm influences future patterns of cluster formation through a model of technical cognition and a mimicking of creativity. It is found that initial firm size has a lasting impact on clustering patterns through its influence on the level of cognitive distance of the underlying agents. The model replicates the stylised facts of entrepreneurial cluster formation."
Responsiveness of Mining Community Acceptance Model to Key Parameter Changes,Mark Kofi Boateng and Kwame Awuah-Offei,"Mining Community, Agent-Based Modeling, Diffusion, Sensitivity Analysis, Mining","The mining industry has difficulties predicting changes in the level of community acceptance of its projects over time. These changes are due to changes in the society and individual perceptions around these mines as a result of the mines’ environmental and social impacts.  Agent-based modeling can be used to facilitate better understanding of how community acceptance changes with changing mine environmental impacts. This work investigates the sensitivity of an agent-based model (ABM) for predicting changes in community acceptance of a mining project due to information diffusion to key input parameters. Specifically, this study investigates the responsiveness of the ABM to average degree (total number of friends) of the social network, close neighbor ratio (a measure of homophily in the social network) and number of early adopters (“innovators”). A two-level full factorial experiment was used to investigate the sensitivity of the model to these parameters. The primary (main), secondary and tertiary effects of each parameter were estimated to assess the model’s sensitivity. The results show that the model is more responsive to close neighbor ratio and number of early adopters than average degree. Consequently, uncertainty surrounding the inferences drawn from simulation experiments using the agent-based model will be minimized by obtaining more reliable estimates of close neighbor ratio and number of early adopters. While it is possible to reliably estimate the level of early adopters from the literature, the degree of homophily (close neighbor ratio) has to be estimated from surveys that can be expensive and unreliable. Further, work is required to find economic ways to document relevant degrees of homophily in social networks in mining communities."
"Thomas C. Schelling and James M. Sakoda: The Intellectual, Technical, and Social History of a Model",Rainer Hegselmann,"Schelling, Sakoda, Checkerboard Models, Tipping Models, Threshold Models, Agent-Based Modeling","The Journal of Mathematical Sociology (JMS) started in 1971. The second issue contained its most cited article:  Thomas C. Schelling,  “Dynamic Models of Segregation”. In that article, Schelling presented a family of models, one of which became a canonical model. To date it is called the Schelling model—an eponym that affixes the inventor’s name to the invention, one of the highest forms of scientific recognition. In the very first issue of JMS, James Minoru Sakoda published an article entitled “The Checkerboard Model of Social Interaction”. Sakoda’s article more or less went unrecognized. Yet, a careful comparison demonstrates that in a certain sense the Schelling model is just an instance of Sakoda’s model. A precursor of that model was already part of Sakoda’s 1949 dissertation submitted to the University of California at Berkeley. A substantial amount of evidence indicates that in the 1970s Sakoda was well known and recognized as a computational social scientist, whereas Schelling was an unknown in the field. A generation later, the pattern of recognition almost completely reversed: Sakoda had become the unknown, while Schelling was the well-known inventor of the pioneering Schelling model. This article explains this puzzling pattern of recognition. Technical and social factors play a decisive role. Some contrafactual historical reflection suggests that the final result was not inevitable."
Enhancing the Realism of Simulation (EROS): On Implementing and Developing Psychological Theory in Social Simulation,Wander Jager,"Psychology, Theory, Needs, Norms, Cognition, Attitudes","Using psychological theory in agent formalisations is relevant to capture behavioural phenomena in simulation models (Enhance Realism Of Simulation - EROS). Whereas the potential contribution of psychological theory is important, also a number of challenges and problems in doing so are discussed. Next examples of implementations of psychological theory are being presented, ranging from simple implementations (KISS) of rather isolated theories to extended models that integrate different theoretical perspectives. The role of social simulation in developing dynamic psychological theory and integrated social psychological modelling is discussed. We conclude with some fundamental limitations and challenges concerning the modelling of human needs, cognition and behaviour."
Friendships and Social Networks in an Individual-Based Model of Primate Social Behaviour,Ivan Puga-Gonzalez and Cedric Sueur,"Individual-Based Model, Friendships, Social Networks, Grooming, Aggression, Macaque Societies","The individual-based model GrooFiWorld proposes a parsimonious theory explaining the complex behavior of macaque societies. It suggests that the socio-spatial structure of the group underlies the emergence of complex behaviour. A spatial structure with dominants at the center and subordinates at the periphery emerges due to aggression. This structure influences the distribution of social interactions: individuals interact more with close-by partners and thus several behavioural patterns emerge. In GrooFiWorld, however, individuals have no preferential interactions; whereas in primates, individuals prefer interactions with ‘friends’. The distribution of interactions, then, may be influenced by ‘friendships’ rather than spatial structure. To study this, here, we omitted space from the model and investigated the effects of ‘friendships’ on the emergence of social behaviour and network structure. Results show that ‘friendships’ promote cooperation but fail to produce other patterns characteristic of macaques. This highlights the importance that spatial structure may have in structuring macaque societies."
Experiments with a Model of Domestic Energy Demand,Nicholas M. Gotts and J. Gary Polhill,"Energy-Use, Goal-Framing, Social-Networks, Values","The CEDSS-3.4 agent-based model of domestic energy demand at community level is described. CEDSS (Community Energy Demand Social Simulator) is focused on household decisions (the model’s agents are households) to buy energy-using appliances, heating systems, and insulation, over the period from 2000 to 2049. Its empirical basis is a survey of households in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire, Scotland, carried out in 2010, combined with publicly available data on household finances and equipment, and energy prices. CEDSS-3.4 emphasises mechanisms concerning value-strength dynamics and goal selection which influence such decisions, drawing on goal-framing theory. Results of experiments with the model are presented; the most important parameters for determining energy demand turn out to be economic (rates of change of incomes and of fuel prices), and the presence or absence of external (extra-community) influences on value-strengths. However, the value-strength dynamics used led in most runs to a single set of values dominating the population by 2049 – but even with identical parameters, different sets of values could become dominant, and which did so made a very considerable difference to demand. This resulted in bimodal distributions of outcome measures across the runs using a given parameter-setting in many cases; initial experiments indicated that changing parameters determining how far households influence each others’ values could at least reduce this tendency. Issues in the analysis of complex models with aspects unconstrained by either data or theory are discussed in the final section."
Modelling Human Behaviours in Disasters from Interviews: Application to Melbourne Bushfires,Carole Adam and Benoit Gaudou,"Human Behaviour Modelling, Agent-Based Social Simulation, Crisis Management","This paper describes a model for raising the decision-makers' awareness of the real (irrational and subjective) behaviours of the population in crisis situations. We analyse residents' statements and police hearings gathered after Victoria Black Saturday bushfires in 2009 to deduce a model of human behaviour based on the distinction between objective (capabilities, danger) and subjective (confidence, risk aversion) attributes, and on individual motivations. We evaluate it against observed behaviour archetypes and statistics, and show its explicative value."
Simulation for Interpretation: A Methodology for Growing Virtual Cultures,Ulf Lotzmann and Martin Neumann,"Interpretative Research Process, Agent-Based Modelling, Generative Social Science, Qualitative Data, Thick Description, Cultural Studies","Agent-based social simulation is well-known for generative explanations. Following the theory of thick description we extend the generative paradigm to interpretative research in cultural studies. Using the example of qualitative data about criminal culture, the paper describes a research process that facilitates interpretative research by growing virtual cultures. Relying on qualitative data for the development of agent rules, the research process combines several steps: Qualitative data analysis following the Grounded Theory paradigm enables concept identification, resulting in the development of a conceptual model of the concept relations. The software tool CCD is used in conceptual modelling which assists semi-automatic transformation in a simulation model developed in the simulation platform DRAMS. Both tools preserve traceability to the empirical evidence throughout the research process. Traceability enables interpretation of simulations by generating a narrative storyline of the simulation. Thereby simulation enables a qualitative exploration of textual data. The whole process generates a thick description of the subject of study, in our example criminal culture. The simulation is characterized by a socio-cognitive coupling of agents’ reasoning on the state of the mind of other agents. This reveals a thick description of how participants make sense of the phenomenology of a situation from the perspective of their worldview."
Social Dynamics of Littering and Adaptive Cleaning Strategies Explored Using Agent-Based Modelling,Ruggero Rangoni and Wander Jager,"Littering, Goal Frame Theory, Tipping Point, Norms","In this paper we explore how social influence may cause a non-linear transition from a clean to a littered environment, and what strategies are effective in keeping a street clean. To study this, we first implement the Goal Framing Theory of Lindenberg and Steg (2007) in an agent based model. Next, using empirical data from a field study we parameterise the model so we can replicate the results from a field study. Following that, we explore how different cleaning strategies perform. The results indicate that an adaptive/dynamical cleaning regime is more effective and cheaper than pre-defined cleaning schedules."
Agent-Based Modelling Approach for Multidimensional Opinion Polarization in Collective Behaviour,Jin Li and Renbin Xiao,"Social Computing, Collective Behaviour, Agent-Based Model, Multidimensional Opinion Polarization, Social Judgement Theory, Multi-Agent System","Opinion polarization in a group is an important phenomenon in collective behaviour that has become increasingly frequent during periods of social transition. In general, an opinion includes several dimensions in reality. By combining social judgement theory with the multi-agent model, we propose a multidimensional opinion evolution model for studying the dynamics of opinion polarization. Compared with previous models, a major contribution is that the opinion of the agent is extended to multiple dimensions, and the BA network is used as a model of real social networks. The results demonstrate that polarization is influenced by the average degree of the network, and the polarization process is affected by the parameters of the assimilation effect and contrast effect. Moreover, the evolution processes in different dimensions of opinion show correlation under certain specific conditions, and the discontinuous equilibrium phenomenon is observed in multidimensional opinion evolution in subsequent experiments."
Product Diffusion Using Advance Selling Strategies: An Online Social Network Perspective,Peng Shao and Ping Hu,"Advance Selling, Product Diffusion, Social Network, Complex Network","This study analyzes the diffusion of two product types using an advance selling strategy from a social network perspective. We extended the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model by adding a buyer component (SIRB) to the model and conducted an in-depth analysis of transmission probability and purchase probability when using an advance selling strategy. Agent-based simulation indicates that cost reduction and promotional effort have positive effects on profits, while lead time negatively affects them. Statistical analyses indicate that lead time has a U-shaped relationship with profits for non-durable products, but an inverted U-shaped relationship with those for durable products. For both products types, promotional effort has an inverted U-shaped relationship with profits under the condition of low-quality products and an inverted U-shaped relationship in the case of high-quality products. The reasons underlying these results are discussed, followed by implications for firms adopting advance selling strategies."
Calibrating with Multiple Criteria: A Demonstration of Dominance,"Jennifer Badham, Chipp Jansen, Nigel Shardlow and Thomas French","Multi-Criteria Decision Making, Calibration, Pattern-Oriented Modelling, Dominance, Behaviour Modelling","Pattern oriented modelling (POM) is an approach to calibration or validation that assesses a model using multiple weak patterns. We extend the concept of POM, using dominance to objectively identify the best parameter candidates. The TELL ME agent-based model is used to demonstrate the approach. This model simulates personal decisions to adopt protective behaviour during an influenza epidemic. The model fit is assessed by the size and timing of maximum behaviour adoption, as well as the more usual criterion of minimising mean squared error between actual and estimated behaviour. The rigorous approach to calibration supported explicit trading off between these criteria, and ultimately demonstrated that there were significant flaws in the model structure."
"Agent-Based Modelling of Social-Ecological Systems: Achievements, Challenges, and a Way Forward","Jule Schulze, Birgit Müller, Jürgen Groeneveld and Volker Grimm","Agent-Based Modelling, Social-Ecological Modelling, Model Development, Model Testing, Model Analysis, Human Decision-Making","Understanding social-ecological systems (SES) is crucial to supporting the sustainable management of resources. Agent-based modelling is a valuable tool to achieve this because it can represent the behaviour and interactions of organisms, human actors and institutions. Agent-based models (ABMs) have therefore already been widely used to study SES. However, ABMs of SES are by their very nature complex. They are therefore difficult to parameterize and analyse, which can limit their usefulness. It is time to critically reflect upon the current state-of-the-art to evaluate to what degree the potential of agent-based modelling for gaining general insights and supporting specific decision-making has already been utilized. We reviewed achievements and challenges by building upon developments in good modelling practice in the field of ecological modelling with its longer history. As a reference, we used the TRACE framework, which encompasses elements of model development, testing and analysis. We firstly reviewed achievements and challenges with regard to the elements of the TRACE framework addressed in reviews and method papers of social-ecological ABMs. Secondly, in a mini-review, we evaluated whether and to what degree the elements of the TRACE framework were addressed in publications on specific ABMs. We identified substantial gaps with regard to (1) communicating whether the models represented real systems well enough for their intended purpose and (2) analysing the models in a systematic and transparent way so that model output is not only observed but also understood. To fill these gaps, a joint effort of the modelling community is needed to foster the advancement and use of strategies such as participatory approaches, standard protocols for communication, sharing of source code, and tools and strategies for model design and analysis. Throughout our analyses, we provide specific recommendations and references for improving the state-of-the-art. We thereby hope to contribute to the establishment of a new advanced culture of agent-based modelling of SES that will allow us to better develop general theory and practical solutions."
"An Empirically Grounded Model of Green Electricity Adoption in Germany: Calibration, Validation and Insights into Patterns of Diffusion",Friedrich Krebs,"Green Electricity, Innovation Diffusion, Spatially Explicit Agent-Based Model, Empirical Calibration and Validation","Spatially explicit agent-based models (ABM) of innovation diffusion have experienced growing attention over the last few years. The ABM presented in this paper investigates the adoption of green electricity tariffs by German households. The model represents empirically characterised household types as agent types which differ in their decision preferences regarding green electricity and other psychological properties. Agent populations are initialised based on spatially explicit socio demographic data describing the sociological lifestyles found in Germany. For model calibration and validation we use historical data on the German green electricity market including a rich dataset of spatially explicit customer data of one of the major providers of green electricity. In order to assess the similarity of the simulation results to historical observations we introduce two validation measures which capture different aspects of the green electricity diffusion. One measure is based on the residuals of spatially-aggregated time series of model indicators and the other measure considers a temporally aggregated but spatially disaggregated indicator of spatial spread. Finally, we demonstrate the descriptive richness of the model by investigating simulation outputs of the calibrated model in more detail. In particular, the results provide insights into the dynamics of the spatial and lifestyle heterogeneity “underneath” the diffusion curve of green electricity in Germany."
"Effort, Satisfaction and Outcomes  in Organisations","Marta Posada, Celia Martín-Sierra and Elena Perez","Effort-Performance, Satisfaction, Organisational Culture, Organizational Structures, Turnover, Human Resource Management Practices","In this paper, an agent-based model of bounded-rational agents, who adapt both their effort intensity (by the interaction with other employees) and their stay-on-the-job-intention (by the alignment of their personal values with the Human-Resource Management (HRM) practices implemented by the organisation), is proposed. Our aim is to analyse: (i) the emergence of an organisational culture and its relationship with both formal organisational structures and employees' effort-behaviours; (ii) the increase of organisational performance by retaining valuable-performance employees whereas poor-performance employees are dismissed. We have obtained that:  (i) Some possible combinations of both employees-effort behaviours and formal organisational structures can favour the emergence of organisational cultures more than others; (ii) The interaction between employees within matrix structures (balanced or strong) with a democratic team leadership favour the emergence of organisational cultures; (iii) High-effort managers are relevant for the emergence of high-performance organisational cultures; (iv) Turnover (voluntary or involuntary) affects to the emergence of organisational culture negatively. We conclude that the main challenge is to retain high effort managers by adapting the set of HRM practices to them."
Can Redistribution by Means of a Progressive Labor Income-Taxation Transfer System Increase Financial Stability?,Thomas Fischer,"Financial Stability, Income and Wealth Inequality, Debt, Redistribution","We present a model featuring heterogeneous households with a conspicuous consumption motive, in which inequality can decrease financial stability, and relate this behavior to the recent financial crisis in the USA. A natural policy conclusion would be to combat income inequality jointly with financial instability by means of a progressive system of taxes and transfers. We investigate this for the case of a simple flat tax system on labor income. The system succeeds in decreasing volatility in asset markets by decreasing the share of high income individuals participating in destabilizing speculation. However, the model provides some very cautious notes on redistribution. As a result of redistribution, all agents are worse off class-wise and accumulate large amounts of debt, posing another potential hazard to financial stability. The latter can be explained by the arms race property of relative consumption. Moreover, the decreased inequality of income (flow) is accompanied by an increased inequality of net-worth (stock)."
Recent Development of Social Simulation as Reflected in JASSS Between 2008 and 2014: A Citation and Co-Citation Analysis,"Jonas Hauke, Iris Lorscheid and Matthias Meyer","Social Simulation, Lines of Research, Multidisciplinary, Citation Analysis, Co-Citation Analysis","The research field of social simulation comprises many topics and research directions. A previous study about the early years indicated that the community has evolved into a differentiated discipline. This paper investigates the recent development of social simulation as reflected in Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation (JASSS) publications from 2008 to 2014. By using citation analysis, we identify the most influential publications and study the characteristics of citations. Additionally, we analyze the development of the field with respect to research topics and their structure in a co-citation analysis. The citation characteristics support the continuing highly multidisciplinary character of JASSS. Prominently cited are methodological papers and books, standards, and NetLogo as the main simulation tool. With respect to the focus of this research, we observe continuity in topics such as opinion dynamics and the evolution of cooperation. While some topics disappeared such as learning, new subjects emerged such as marriage formation models and tools and platforms. Overall, one can observe a maturing inter- and multidisciplinary scientific community in which both methodological issues and specific social science topics are discussed and standards have emerged."
A Psychologically-Motivated Model of Opinion Change with Applications to American Politics,Peter Duggins,"Agent-Based Model, Opinion Dynamics, Social Networks, Conformity, Polarization, Extremism","Agent-based models are versatile tools for studying how societal opinion change, including political polarization and cultural diffusion, emerges from individual behavior. This study expands agents' psychological realism using empirically-motivated rules governing interpersonal influence, commitment to previous beliefs, and conformity in social contexts. Computational experiments establish that these extensions produce three novel results: (a) sustained strong diversity of opinions within the population, (b) opinion subcultures, and (c) pluralistic ignorance. These phenomena arise from a combination of agents' intolerance, susceptibility and conformity, with extremist agents and social networks playing important roles. The distribution and dynamics of simulated opinions reproduce two empirical datasets on Americans' political opinions."
An Agent-Based Model of Electricity Consumer: Smart Metering Policy Implications in Europe,"Julija Vasiljevska, Jochem Douw, Anna Mengolini and Igor Nikolic","Electricity Consumer, Agent-Based Modelling, Smart Metering, Consumer Values","EU Regulation 2009/72/EC concerning common rules for internal market in electricity calls upon 80% of EU electricity consumers to be equipped with smart metering systems by 2020,  provided that a positive economic assessment of all long-term costs and benefits to the market and the individual consumer is guaranteed. Understanding the impact that smart metering systems may have on the electricity stakeholders (consumers, distribution system operators, energy suppliers and the society at large) is important for faster and effective deployment of such systems and of the innovative services they offer. For this purpose, in this paper an agent-based model is developed, where the electricity consumer behaviour due to different smart metering policies is simulated. Consumers are modelled as household agents having dynamic preferences on types of electricity contracts offered by the supplier. Development of preferences depends on personal values, memory and attitudes, as well as the degree of interaction in a social network structure. We are interested in exploring possible diffusion rates of smart metering enabled services under different policy interventions and the impact of this technological diffusion on individual and societal performance indicators. In four simulation experiments and three intervention policies we observe the diffusion of energy services and individual and societal performance indicators (electricity savings, CO2 emissions savings, social welfare, consumers' comfort change), as well as consumers' satisfaction. From these results and based on expert validation, we conclude that providing the consumer with more options does not necessarily lead to higher consumer's satisfaction, or better societal performance. A good policy should be centred on effective ways to tackle consumers concerns."
Improving Execution Speed of Models Implemented in NetLogo,"Steven Railsback, Daniel Ayllón, Uta Berger, Volker Grimm, Steven Lytinen, Colin Sheppard and Jan Thiele","Agent-Based Modeling, Computational Efficiency, Execution Speed, Individual-Based Modeling, NetLogo, Modeling Platforms","NetLogo has become a standard platform for agent-based simulation, yet there appears to be widespread belief that it is not suitable for large and complex models due to slow execution. Our experience does not support that belief. NetLogo programs often do run very slowly when written to minimize code length and maximize clarity, but relatively simple and easily tested changes can almost always produce major increases in execution speed. We recommend a five-step process for quantifying execution speed, identifying slow parts of code, and writing faster code. Avoiding or improving agent filtering statements can often produce dramatic speed improvements. For models with extensive initialization methods, reorganizing the setup procedure can reduce the initialization effort in simulation experiments. Programming the same behavior in a different way can sometimes provide order-of-magnitude speed increases. For models in which most agents do nothing on most time steps, discrete event simulation—facilitated by the time extension to NetLogo—can dramatically increase speed. NetLogo’s BehaviorSpace tool makes it very easy to conduct multiple-model-run experiments in parallel on either desktop or high performance cluster computers, so even quite slow models can be executed thousands of times. NetLogo also is supported by efficient analysis tools, such as BehaviorSearch and RNetLogo, that can reduce the number of model runs and the effort to set them up for (e.g.) parameterization and sensitivity analysis."
The Practice of Archiving Model Code of Agent-Based Models,Marco A. Janssen,"Bibliometrics, Replication, Open Science, Computational Science","To evaluate the concern over the reproducibility of computational science, we reviewed 2367 journal articles on agent-based models published between 1990 and 2014 and documented the public availability of source code. The percentage of publications that make the model code available is about 10%. The percentages are similar for publications that are reportedly dependent on public funding. There are big differences among journals in the public availability of model code and software used. This suggests that the varying social norms and practical convenience around sharing code may explain some of the differences among different sectors of the scientific community."
Augmenting Bottom-up Metamodels with Predicates,"Ross Gore, Saikou Diallo, Christopher Lynch and Jose Padilla","Metamodel, Agent-Based Simulation, Statistical Modeling, Predicates, Validation","Metamodeling refers to modeling a model. There are two metamodeling approaches for ABMs: (1) top-down and (2) bottom-up. The top down approach enables users to decompose high-level mental models into behaviors and interactions of agents. In contrast, the bottom-up approach constructs a relatively small, simple model that approximates the structure and outcomes of a dataset gathered from the runs of an ABM. The bottom-up metamodel makes behavior of the ABM comprehensible and exploratory analyses feasible. For most users the construction of a bottom-up metamodel entails: (1) creating an experimental design, (2) running the simulation for all cases specified by the design, (3) collecting the inputs and output in a dataset and (4) applying first-order regression analysis to find a model that effectively estimates the output. Unfortunately, the sums of input variables employed by first-order regression analysis give the impression that one can compensate for one component of the system by improving some other component even if such substitution is inadequate or invalid. As a result the metamodel can be misleading. We address these deficiencies with an approach that: (1) automatically generates Boolean conditions that highlight when substitutions and tradeoffs among variables are valid and (2) augments the bottom-up metamodel with the conditions to improve validity and accuracy. We evaluate our approach using several established agent-based simulations."
Axiomatic Theory and Simulation: A Philosophy of Science Perspective on Schelling's Segregation Model,Klaus G. Troitzsch,"Theory Reconstruction, Non-Statement View, Schelling Model, Segregation, Axiom","The paper uses Schelling’s famous segregation model and a number of extensions to show how a reconstruction of the theory behind these models along the lines of the ‘non-statement view’ on empirical science can contribute to a better understanding of these models and a more straightforward implementation. A short introduction to the procedure of reconstructing a theory is given, using an extremely simple theory from mechanics. The same procedure is then applied to Schelling’s segregation theory. A number of extensions to Schelling’s model are analysed that relax the original idealisations, such as adding different tolerance levels between the two subpopulations, assuming inhomogeneous subpopulations and heterogeneous experiences of neighbourhoods, among others. Finally, it is argued that a ‘non-statement view’ reconstruction of a mental model or a verbally expressed theory are relevant for a useful specification for a simulation model."
Macroeconomic Policy in DSGE and Agent-Based Models Redux: New Developments and Challenges Ahead,Giorgio Fagiolo and Andrea Roventini,"Economic Policy, Agent-Based Models, DSGE Models, Great Recession","The Great Recession seems to be a natural experiment for economic analysis, in that it has shown the inadequacy of the predominant theoretical framework - the New Neoclassical Synthesis (NNS) - grounded on the DSGE model. In this paper, we present a critical discussion of the theoretical, empirical and political-economy pitfalls of the DSGE-based approach to policy analysis. We suggest that a more fruitful research avenue should escape the strong theoretical requirements of NNS models (e.g., equilibrium, rationality, representative agent, etc.) and consider the economy as a complex evolving system, i.e. as an ecology populated by heterogenous agents, whose far-from-equilibrium interactions continuously change the structure of the system. This is indeed the methodological core of agent-based computational economics (ACE), which is presented in this paper. We also discuss how ACE has been applied to policy analysis issues, and we provide a survey of macroeconomic policy applications (fiscal and monetary policy, bank regulation, labor market structural reforms and climate change interventions). Finally, we conclude by discussing the methodological status of ACE, as well as the problems it raises."
How Social Unrest Started Innovations in a Food Supply Chain,"Jan Buurma, Wil Hennen and Tim Verwaart","Sociotechnical Innovation, Opinion Dynamics, Content Analysis, Dramaturgical Analysis, Food Supply Chain","Transitions leading to sociotechnical innovations in food supply chains have been described in dramaturgical analyses on the basis of newspaper articles and parliamentary records. The time scale of the transitions driven by aroused public opinion on issues such as animal welfare, is typically a decade. Actors are primary producers (farmers), other supply chain parties, authorities, NGOs voicing particular opinions, political parties, and consumers. In this article, their interactions and reactions to external events are modelled in an agent-based simulation based on opinion dynamics. The purposes of the simulation are (1) to validate that hypothetical relations derived from the dramaturgical analysis indeed lead to the emergence of the observed transitions, and (2) to study how the system could have developed under different behaviours or a different course of external events. Simulation results and a sensitivity analysis are discussed."
From Micro Behaviors to Macro Dynamics: An Agent-Based Economic Model with Consumer Credit,Paola D'Orazio and Gianfranco Giulioni,"Agent-Based Model, Credit Supply, Consumer Debt, Precautionary Saving, Wealth Distribution, Labor Market Matching","The paper develops an agent-based model populated by heterogeneous consumers, a productive sector and a banking sector. Taking a bottom up approach, the paper aims at providing a first tool to analyze households' borrowing dynamics in the different phases of the business cycle by relaxing some assumptions of mainstream consumption models and considering more realistic household borrowing behaviors. Although very simple, the model allows us to grasp the main implications of the interaction between consumers' wants (desired consumption), consumers' beliefs (their expectations about their future income), the behavior of the banking sector (rationing) and the behavior of the production sector (forecasting future demand). After presenting and discussing sensitivity analysis over a parameters' set, the paper reports results and the ex-post validation by comparing artificial and empirical distributions computed using the European Household Finance and Consumption Survey data set."
An Agent Based Model for a Double Auction with Convex Incentives,Annalisa Fabretti and Stefano Herzel,"Incentives, Agent-Based Simulations, Market Instability, Price Convergence, Order Book Analysis","We studied the influence of convex incentives, e.g. option-like compensations, on the behavior of financial markets. Such incentives, usually offered to portfolio managers, have been often considered a potential source of market instability. We built an agent-based model of a double-auction market where some of the agents are endowed with convex contracts. We show that these contracts encourage traders to buy more aggressively, increasing total demand and market prices. Our analysis suggests that financial markets with many managers with convex contracts are more likely to be more unstable and less efficient."
The Interplay Between Conformity and Anticonformity and its Polarizing Effect on Society,"Patryk Siedlecki, Janusz Szwabiński and Tomasz Weron","Opinion Dynamics, Social Influence, Conformity, Anticonformity, Bi-Polarization, Agent-Based Modelling","Simmering debates leading to polarization are observed in many domains. Although empirical findings show a strong correlation between this phenomenon and modularity of a social network, still little is known about the actual mechanisms driving communities to conflicting opinions. In this paper, we used an agent-based model to check if the polarization may be induced by a competition between two types of social response: conformity and anticonformity. The proposed model builds on the q-voter model (Castellano et al, 2009b) and uses a double-clique topology in order to capture segmentation of a community. Our results indicate that the interplay between intra-clique conformity and inter-clique anticonformity may indeed lead to a bi-polarized state of the entire system. We have found a dynamic phase transition controlled by the fraction L of negative cross-links between cliques. In the regime of small values of L the system is able to reach the total positive consensus. If the values of L are large enough, anticonformity takes over and the system always ends up in a polarized stated. Putting it the other way around, the segmentation of the network is not a sufficient condition for the polarization to appear. A suitable level of antagonistic interactions between segments is required to arrive at a polarized steady state within our model."
From Consumer Decision to Market Share – Unanimity of Majority?,Agnieszka Kowalska-Styczeń and Katarzyna Sznajd-Weron,"Agent-Based Model, Word of Mouth Marketing, Cellular Automata, Consumer Behavior","We use a general cellular automata model to study the consumer decision-making process. Within this general model we use three different rules governing word-of-mouth communication (w-o-m), one majority rule and two unanimity rules, and ask the question if differences between these three w-o-m rules, introduced on the microscopic level, will manifest on the macroscopic level. We show that in the model with the majority rule the neighborhood plays a significant role in terms of the market shares whereas movement (interpreted as seeking for information in other sources) is almost negligible. Exactly the opposite phenomena are observed for models in which unanimity, instead of majority, is needed to convince agents. We also introduce a modification of the unanimity rule, based on the Latane theory of the social influence, and show that on the macroscopic level this modification is indistinguishable from the simple unanimity rule. We conclude the paper with a recommendation which rules are more appropriate to model particular marketing phenomena."
Dynamics of Uncertain Opinion Formation: An Agent-Based Simulation,"Haiming Liang, Yucheng Dong and Congcong Li","Opinion Formation, Uncertain Opinions, Uncertainty Tolerance, Communication Regime, Agent-Based Simulation","Opinion formation describes the dynamics of opinions in a group of interaction agents and is a powerful tool for predicting the evolution and diffusion of the opinions. The existing opinion formation studies assume that the agents express their opinions by using the exact number, i.e., the exact opinions. However, when people express their opinions, sentiments, and support emotions regarding different issues, such as politics, products, and events, they often cannot provide the exact opinions but express uncertain opinions. Furthermore, due to the differences in culture backgrounds and characters of agents, people who encounter uncertain opinions often show different uncertainty tolerances. The goal of this study is to investigate the dynamics of uncertain opinion formation in the framework of bounded confidence. By taking different uncertain opinions and different uncertainty tolerances into account, we use an agent-based simulation to investigate the influences of uncertain opinions in opinion formation from two aspects: the ratios of the agents that express uncertain opinions and the widths of the uncertain opinions, and also provide the explanations of the observations obtained."
The Extortion Relationship: A Computational Analysis,Corinna Elsenbroich and Jennifer Badham,"Extortion Racketeering, Game Theory, Social Dynamics","Systematic extortion involves a long term parasitic relationship between the criminal and the victim. Game theory analysis has provided insight into the choices of individual hypothetical criminal and victim pairs. In this paper we present an agent-based model so as to extend the analysis to the relationship between extorters and other potential victims. The model is developed in two stages, the first to be closest to game theory, the second one making the decision informed by the social environment of the victim. The agent-based model shows the importance of social aspects for the functioning of extortion rackets."
A Heuristic Combinatorial Optimisation Approach to Synthesising a Population for Agent Based Modelling Purposes,"Nam Huynh, Johan Barthelemy and Pascal Perez","Synthetic Population, Combinatorial Optimisation, Sample-Free, Agent Based Modelling, Social Behaviours","This paper presents an algorithm that follows the sample-free approach to synthesise a population for agent based modelling purposes. This algorithm is among the very few in the literature that do not rely on a sample survey data to construct a synthetic population, and thus enjoy a potentially wider applications where such survey data is not available or inaccessible. Different to existing sample-free algorithms, the population synthesis presented in this paper applies the heuristics to part of the allocation of synthetic individuals into synthetic households. As a result the iterative process allocating individuals into households, which normally is the most computationally demanding and time consuming process, is required only for a subset of synthetic individuals. The population synthesiser in this work is therefore computational efficient enough for practical application to build a large synthetic population (many millions) for many thousands target areas at the smallest possible geographical level. This capability ensures that the geographical heterogeneity of the resulting synthetic population is best preserved. The paper also presents the application of the new method to synthesise the population for New South Wales in Australia in 2006. The resulting total synthetic population has approximately 6 million people living in over 2.3 million households residing in private dwellings across over 11000 Census Collection Districts. Analyses show evidence that the synthetic population matches very well with the census data across seven demographics attributes that characterise the population at both household level and individual level."
Modeling Spatial Contacts for Epidemic Prediction in a Large-Scale Artificial City,"Mingxin Zhang, Alexander Verbraeck, Rongqing Meng, Bin Chen and Xiaogang Qiu","Spatial Contacts, Agent-Based Modeling, Artificial City","Spatial contacts among human beings are considered as one of the influential factors during the transmission of contagious diseases, such as influenza and tuberculosis. Therefore, representing and understanding spatial contacts plays an important role in epidemic modeling research. However, most current research only considers regular spatial contacts such as contacts at home/school/office, or they assume static social networks for modeling social contacts and omit travel contacts in their epidemic models. This paper describes a way to model relatively complete spatial contacts in the context of a large-scale artificial city, which combines different data sources to construct an agent-based model of the city Beijing. In this model, agents have regular contacts when executing their daily activity patterns which is similar to other large-scale agent-based epidemic models. Besides, a microscopic public transportation component is included in the artificial city to model public travel contacts. Moreover, social contacts also emerge in this model due to the dynamic generation of social networks. To systematically examine the effect of the relatively complete spatial contacts have for epidemic prediction in the artificial city, a pandemic influenza disease progression model was implemented in this artificial city. The simulation results validated the model. In addition, the way to model spatial contacts in this paper shows potential not only for improving comprehension of disease spread dynamics, but also for use in other social systems, such as public transportation systems and city level evacuation planning."
A Simple Agent-Based Spatial Model of the Economy:   Tools for Policy,Bernardo Alves Furtado and Isaque Daniel Rocha Eberhardt,"Modeling, Agent-Based Models, Public Finance, Taxes, Municipalities, Quality of Life","This study simulates the evolution of artificial economies in order to understand the tax relevance of administrative boundaries in the quality of life of its citizens. The modeling involves the construction of a computational algorithm, which includes citizens, bounded into families; firms and governments; all of them interacting in markets for goods, labor and real estate. The real estate market allows families to move to dwellings with higher quality or lower price when the families capitalize property values. The goods market allows consumers to search on a flexible number of firms choosing by price and proximity. The labor market entails a matching process between firms (given its location) and candidates, according to their qualification. The government may be configured into one, four or seven distinct sub-national governments, which are all economically conurbated. The role of government is to collect taxes on the value added of firms in its territory and invest the taxes into higher levels of quality of life for residents. The results suggest that the configuration of administrative boundaries is relevant to the levels of quality of life arising from the reversal of taxes. The model with seven regions is more dynamic, but more unequal and heterogeneous across regions. The simulation with only one region is more homogeneously poor. The study seeks to contribute to a theoretical and methodological framework as well as to describe, operationalize and test computer models of public finance analysis, with explicitly spatial and dynamic emphasis. Several alternatives of expansion of the model for future research are described. Moreover, this study adds to the existing literature in the realm of simple microeconomic computational models, specifying structural relationships between local governments and firms, consumers and dwellings mediated by distance."
Simulation of Technology Sourcing Overseas Post-Merger Behaviors in a Global Game Model,"Feiqiong Chen, Qiaoshuang Meng and Fei Li","Post-Merger Integration, Technology Innovation, Multi-Agent Simulation, Integration Degree, Target Autonomy","The abilities to efficiently identify potential innovation profits and form an optimal post-merger strategy are key to evaluating overseas merger and acquisition (M&A) performances. The paper uses a global game with asymmetric payoff structure and multi-agent simulation methods to analyze the optimal overseas post-merger strategy. We model three stages of the M&A processes: merger decision stage, post-merger integration stage, and technology innovation after M&A, to analyze how different resource similarity and resource complementarity of the two companies influence the degree of optimal post-merger integration and target autonomy as well as technology innovation profit after M&A. The agent-based simulation shows that, in overseas M&As, resource similarity has a positive relation with integration and a negative relation with target autonomy; however, resource complementarity has the opposite effect. The negative interaction effect between resource similarity and complementarity will decrease the degrees of integration. In high-resource-similarity and low-resource-complementarity M&As, a high integration degree and low target autonomy will maximize innovation profit, while for high-resource-similarity and high-resource-complementarity M&As, a high integration degree and target autonomy is best for innovation profit. For low-resource-similarity and high-resource-complementarity M&As, a low integration degree and high target autonomy will be the best post-merger strategy. Model outputs are robust to variations of the parameters."
Agent-Based Simulation to Inform Planning Strategies for Welfare Facilities for the Elderly: Day Care Center Development in a Japanese City,"Yan Ma, Zhenjiang Shen and Dinh Thanh Nguyen","Planning Support, Population Aging, Day-Care Center, Lifecycle Stage","In recent decades, the demands of welfare facilities for elderly people is raising rapidly in Japan. Local governments in Japan manage to supply elderly people with numerous health care services according to a new national-wide residential planning for aged population. In this research we will introduce an agent-based simulation model that can be used to help local government for getting insight on planning strategy regarding daycare center (DC center) development for elderly people through simulation, in which the simulation model of human lifecycle stage is integrated with the simulation model of DC center development and operation. Through simulating the behaviors of local government policy-maker, elderly people, daycare center owner, it is able to forecast the demand for DCs in the simulation environment. The simulation framework of the DC development and operation was designed on the rules and laws of Japan for daycare services, which follow the procedure of elderly people applying for daycare center services, government certificating them to choose and visit daycare centers and also, daycare center owners developing DC centers and operating on them. In present research, the model has been tested by using the real GIS dataset of a Japanese local city from the year 2000 to 2010 and then, further used to forecast the demand for daycare centers of local elderly people till the year 2030. The visualized simulation results show the possibility of using this model for supporting local government to review the planning strategy on DCs."
Ontology Based Business Simulations,"Thomas Farrenkopf, Michael Guckert, Neil Urquhart and Simon Wells","Social Simulation, Ontology, BDI Agent","Within business games there is a need to provide realistic feedback for decisions made, if such business games are to continue to remain relevant in increasingly complex business environments. We address this problem by using software agents to simulate individuals and to model their actions in response to business decisions. In our initial studies we have used software agents to simulate consumers who make buying decisions based on their private preferences and those prevalent within their social network. This approach can be applied to search for behavioural patterns in social structures and to verify predicted values based on a priori theoretical considerations. Individual behaviour can be modelled for each agent and its effects within the marketplace can be examined by running simulations. Our simulations are founded upon the BDI software model (belief-desire-intention) combined with ontologies to make world knowledge available to the agents which can then determine their actions in accordance with this knowledge. We demonstrate how ontologies can be integrated into the BDI concept utilising the Jadex agent framework. Our examples are based upon the simulation of market mechanisms within the context of different industries. We use a framework, developed previously, known as AGADE within which each agent evolves its knowledge using an ontology maintained during the simulation. This generic approach allows the simulation of various consumer scenarios which can be modelled by creating appropriate ontologies."
Enhancing Agent-Based Models with Discrete Choice Experiments,"Stefan Holm, Renato Lemm, Oliver Thees and Lorenz M. Hilty","Agent-Based Modeling, Discrete Choice Experiments, Preference Elicitation, Decision Model, Market Simulation, Wood Market","Agent-based modeling is a promising method to investigate market dynamics, as it allows modeling the behavior of all market participants individually. Integrating empirical data in the agents’ decision model can improve the validity of agent-based models (ABMs). We present an approach of using discrete choice experiments (DCEs) to enhance the empirical foundation of ABMs. The DCE method is based on random utility theory and therefore has the potential to enhance the ABM approach with a well-established economic theory. Our combined approach is applied to a case study of a roundwood market in Switzerland. We conducted DCEs with roundwood suppliers to quantitatively characterize the agents’ decision model. We evaluate our approach using a fitness measure and compare two DCE evaluation methods, latent class analysis and hierarchical Bayes. Additionally, we analyze the influence of the error term of the utility function on the simulation results and present a way to estimate its probability distribution."
Exploring the Combined Effect of Factors Influencing Commuting Patterns and CO2 Emissions in Aberdeen Using an Agent-Based Model,Jiaqi Ge and Gary Polhill,"Agent-Based Model, Commuting, CO2 Emissions, Flexitime, Urban Concentration","This paper develops an agent-based model of the daily commute in Aberdeen City and the surrounding area in Scotland, UK. We study the impact of flexitime work arrangements, urban concentration, a new bypass, and cycle lanes on commute time length, reliability and CO2 emissions, and analyse the diverse conflation of these factors and the different connections of them in order to detect their cumulative effects. Our results suggest that flexitime will reduce CO2 emissions from traffic. It also reduces mean commute time and makes commute time more reliable. We find that although higher urban concentration will make travel time less reliable, it will reduce CO2 emissions from commuting and cut commute time length. There might also be a trade-off between travel time length and reliability regarding urban concentration. We show that the new bypass will only reduce mean commute time by a small amount, while slightly increasing total CO2 emissions. Finally, we find that cyclists sharing roads with cars do not necessarily slow down the traffic on the whole. We conclude that infrastructural, social and urban issues should never be studied in isolation with each other, and that urban policies will have ramifications for both urban and surrounding ex-urban areas."
Revising the Human Development Sequence Theory Using an Agent-Based Approach and Data,Viktoria Spaiser and David J. T. Sumpter,"Agent-Based Simulation, Human Development Sequence Theory, Democratisation, Mathematical Modeling, Data Analysis, Inequality","Agent-based models and computer simulations are promising tools for studying emergent macro-phenomena. We apply an agent-based approach in combination with data analysis to investigate the human development sequence (HDS) theory developed by Ronald Inglehart and Christian Welzel. Although the HDS theory is supported by correlational evidence, the sequence of economic growth, democracy and emancipation stated by the theory is not entirely consistent with data. We use an agent-based model to make quantitative predictions about several different micro-level mechanisms. Comparison to data allows us to identify important inconsistencies between HDS and the data, and propose revised agent-based models that modify the theory. Our results indicate the importance of elites and economic inequality in explaining the data available on democratisation."
Using Computational Modeling for Building Theory: A Double Edged Sword,Christopher Poile and Frank Safayeni,"Computational Modeling, Simulation, Theory-Building, Equifinality","Computational modeling is a powerful method for building theory. However, to construct a computational model, researchers need to operationalize their cognitive or verbal theory into the specific terms demanded by the simulation’s language. This requires the researcher to make a series of reasonable assumptions to fill unanticipated “specificity gaps.” The problem is that many other reasonable assumptions could also have been made, and many of those resulting models would also match the conceptual theory. This is the problem of equifinality. We demonstrate the power and the dangers of computational modeling by building a simulation of a classic small group study. The results demonstrate that reasonable assumptions and equifinality are straightforward (but often overlooked) problems at the core of genuinely useful methodology. We offer recommendations and hope to open a dialog on other perspectives and solutions."
The Emergence of Climate Change Mitigation Action by Society: An Agent-Based Scenario Discovery Study,"Sebastiaan Greeven, Oscar Kraan, Émile J.L. Chappin and Jan H. Kwakkel","Agent-Based Modeling, Scenario Discovery, Uncertainty, Climate Change Mitigation, Exploratory Modeling","Developing model-based narratives of society’s response to climate change is challenged by two factors. First, society’s response to possible future climate change is subject to many uncertainties. Second, we argue that society’s mitigation action emerge out of the actions and interactions of the many actors in society. Together, these two factors imply that the overarching dynamics of society’s response to climate change are unpredictable. In contrast to conventional processes of developing scenarios, in this study the emergence of climate change mitigation action by society has been represented in an agent-based model with which we developed two narratives of the emergence of climate change mitigation action by applying exploratory modelling and analysis. The agent-based model represents a two-level game involving governments and citizens changing their emission behaviour in the face of climate change through mitigation action. Insights gained from the exploration on uncertainties pertaining to the system have been used to construct two internally consistent and plausible narratives on the pathways of the emergence of mitigation action, which, as we argue, are a reasonable summary of the uncertainty space. The first narrative highlights how and when strong mitigation action emerges while the second narrative highlights how and when weak mitigation action emerges. In contrast to a conventional scenario development process, these two scenarios have been discovered bottom up rather than being defined top down. They succinctly capture the possible outcomes of the emergence of climate change mitigation by society across a large range of uncertain factors. The narratives therefore help in conveying the consequences of the various uncertainties influencing the emergence of climate change mitigation action by society."
"A Multiagent-Based Tool for the Simulation of Social Production and Management Processes of Urban Ecosystems Using the JaCaMo Framework: A Case Study of San Jerónimo Vegetable Garden - Seville, Spain","Flavia Santos, Diana Francisca Adamatti, Henrique Rodrigues, Glenda Dimuro, Esteban De Manuel Jerez and Graçaliz Dimuro","Urban Ecosystem, Social Organization Simulation, Simulation of Social Production and Management Processes, Regulatory Policy Simulation, Multiagent-Based Simulations, JaCaMo Framework","The concept of social production and management of urban ecosystems may be understood as the generation of new physical or relational situations, by constructing, transforming or eliminating physical and/or relational objects or ensuring the fulfillment of their social and environmental functions. This includes the citizen participation in the process of urban planning and transformation, forming a network structured and supported by tools allowing the equal distribution of power in the decision making.  The SJVG-MAS Project addresses, in an interdisciplinary approach, the development of computational tools based on Multiagent Systems (MAS) for the simulation of the social production and management processes that occur in urban ecosystems, in particular, the San Jerónimo Vegetable Garden project (Spain). In this paper, we present a MAS-based simulation tool developed in JaCaMo. We conceived a 5-dimensional BDI-like agent social system composed of the agents' population, the social organization, the environment, the interactional/communication and the regulatory structures."
Oscillatory Patterns in the Amount of Demand for Dental Visits: An Agent Based Modeling Approach,"Maryam Sadeghipour, Peyman Shariatpanahi, Afshin Jafari, Mohammad Hossein Khosnevisan and Arezoo Ebn Ahmady","Dental Health Care, Dental Routine Visit, Oscillatory Patterns, Agent Based Modeling, Google Trends","There are some empirical evidences indicating that there is a collective complex oscillatory pattern in the amount of demand for dental visit at society level. In order to find the source of the complex cyclic behavior, we develop an agent-based model of collective behavior of routine dental check-ups in a social network. Simulation results show that demand for routine dental check-ups can follow an oscillatory pattern and the pattern’s characteristics are highly dependent upon the structure of the social network of potential patients, the population, and the number of effective contacts between individuals. Such a cyclic pattern has public health consequences for patients and economic consequences for providers. The amplitude of oscillations was analyzed under different scenarios and for different network topologies. This allows us to  postulate a simulation-based theory for the likelihood observing and the magnitude of a cyclic demand. Results show that in case of random networks, as the number of contacts increases, the oscillatory pattern reaches its maximum intensity, for any population size. In case of ring lattice networks, the amplitude of oscillations reduces considerably, when compared to random networks, and the oscillation intensity is strongly dependent on population. The results for small world networks is a combination of random and ring lattice networks. In addition, the simulation results are compared to empirical data from Google Trends for oral health related search queries in different United States cities. The empirical data indicates an oscillatory behavior for the level of attention to dental and oral health care issues. Furthermore, the oscillation amplitude is  correlated with town’s population. The data fits the case of random networks when the number of effective contacts is about 4-5 for each person. These results suggest that our model can be used for a fraction of people deeply involved in Internet activities like Web-based social networks and Google search."
"Simulating the Transmission of Foot-And-Mouth Disease Among Mobile Herds in the Far North Region, Cameroon","Hyeyoung Kim, Ningchuan Xiao, Mark Moritz, Rebecca Garabed and Laura W. Pomeroy","Foot-And-Mouth Disease (FMD), Mobility, Disease Transmission, Transhumance, SIR Model, Agent-Based-Model (ABM)","Animal and human movements can impact the transmission of infectious diseases. Modeling such impacts presents a significant challenge to disease transmission models because these models often assume a fully mixing population where individuals have an equal chance to contact each other. Whereas movements result in populations that can be best represented as a dynamic networks whose structure changes over time as individual movements result in changing distances between individuals within a population. We model the impact of the movements of mobile pastoralists on foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) transmission in a transhumance system in the Far North Region of Cameroon. The pastoralists in our study area move their livestock between rainy and dry season pastures. We first analyzed transhumance data to derive mobility rules that can be used to simulate the movements of the agents in our model. We developed an agent-based model coupled with a susceptible–infected–recovered (SIR) model. Each agent represents a camp of mobile pastoralists with multiple herds and households. The simulation results demonstrated that the herd mobility significantly influenced the dynamics of FMD. When the grazing area is not explicitly considered (by setting the buffer size to 100 km), all the model simulations suggested the same curves as the results using a fully mixing population. Simulations that used grazing areas observed in the field (≤5 km radius) resulted in multiple epidemic peaks in a year, which is similar to the empirical evidence that we obtained by surveying herders from our study area over the last four years."
TreatMethHarm: An Agent-Based Simulation of How People Who Use Methamphetamine Access Treatment,"Francois Lamy, Brendan Quinn, Robyn Dwyer, Nicola Thomson, David Moore and Paul Dietze","Agent-Based Modelling, Methamphetamine Use, Drug-Related Harms, Treatment Access, Drug Career","Methamphetamine use in Australia has recently attracted considerable attention due to increased human and social costs. Despite evidences indicating increasing methamphetamine-related harm and significant numbers of frequent and dependent users, methamphetamine treatment coverage remains low in Australia. This paper aims to investigate the complex interplay between methamphetamine use and treatment-related access by designing an agent-based model, using epidemiological data and expert-derived assumptions. This paper presents the architecture and core mechanisms of an agent-based model, TreatMethHarm, and details the results of model calibration performed by testing the key model parameters. At this stage of development, TreatMethHarm is able to produce proportions of methamphetamine users that replicate those produced by our epidemiological survey. However, this agent-based model still requires additional information and further tests before validation. TreatMethHarm provides a useful tool to elicit dialogue between researchers from different disciplines, integrate a variety of data and identify missing information."
"Learning with Communication Barriers Due to Overconfidence. What a ""Model-To-Model Analysis"" Can Add to the Understanding of a Problem",Juliette Rouchier and Emily Tanimura,"Collective Learning, Agent-Based Simulation, M2M, Influence Model, Analytical Model, Over-Confidence","In this paper, we describe a process of validation for an already published model, which relies on the M2M paradigm of work. The initial model showed that over-confident agents, which refuse to communicate with agents whose beliefs differ, disturb collective learning within a population. We produce an analytical model based on probabilistic analysis, that enables us to explain better the process at stake in our first model, and demonstrates that this process is indeed converging. To make sure that the convergence time is meaningful for our question (not just for an infinite number of agents living for an infinite time), we use the analytical model to produce very simple simulations and assess that the result holds in finite contexts."
Modeling Interaction Effects in Polarization: Individual Media Influence and the Impact of Town Meetings,"Eric Pulick, Patrick Korth, Patrick Grim and Jiin Jung","Polarization, Media, Opinion, Social Networks, Town Meetings, Reinforcement","We are increasingly exposed to polarized media sources, with clear evidence that individuals choose those sources closest to their existing views.  We also have a tradition of open face-to-face group discussion in town meetings, for example.  There are a range of current proposals to revive the role of group meetings in democratic decision-making. Here, we build a simulation that instantiates aspects of reinforcement theory in a model of competing social influences.  What can we expect in the interaction of polarized media with group interaction along the lines of town meetings?  Some surprises are evident from a computational model that includes both.  Deliberative group discussion can be expected to produce opinion convergence.  That convergence may not, however, be a cure for extreme views polarized at opposite ends of the opinion spectrum.  In a large class of cases, we show that adding the influence of group meetings in an environment of self-selected media produces not a moderate central consensus but opinion convergence at one of the extremes defined by polarized media."
An Empirical Game-Theoretic Analysis of the Dynamics of Cooperation in Small Groups,Steve Phelps,"Evolution, Cooperation, Reciprocity","Many models of the evolution of cooperation have shown the importance of direct reciprocity (for example “tit for tat” strategies) or alternatively indirect reciprocity (conspicuous altruism based on a reputation or “image score”). In the latter case many models make the implicit assumption that group sizes are large relative to the expected number of interactions, which makes their analysis more tractable in several ways, not least by allowing us to ignore any strategic interaction between the direct and indirect classes of reciprocation strategy. However, in smaller groups the possibility arises that both classes of strategy will play a role in determining the equilibrium behaviour. Therefore we introduce a replicator dynamics model which incorporates both direct and indirect reciprocity, and use simulation and numerical methods to quantitatively assess how the level of cooperation in equilibrium is affected by changes in the group size and the frequency with which other group members are encountered. Our analysis shows that, for intermediate group sizes, direct reciprocity persists in equilibrium alongside indirect reciprocity. In contrast to previous simulation studies, we provide a sound game-theoretic underpinning to our analysis, and examine the precise conditions which give rise to a mix of both forms of reciprocity."
Lifestyle Tradeoffs and the Decline of Societal Well-Being: An Agent-Based Model,Christopher Thron,"Well-Being, Conspicuous Consumption, Overvaluation, Tradeoffs, Satisfaction, Social Capital","This paper presents a semi-quantitative mathematical model of the changes over time in the statistical distribution of well-being of individuals in a society. The model predicts that when individuals overvalue the more socially conspicuous aspects of well-being in their lifestyle choices, then the average well-being of the overall population may experience continuous decline. In addition to tradeoff cost and overvaluation, we identify statistical variation in individuals’ well-being and turnover within the population as key factors driving negative trends. We investigate the influence of the effects of heterogeneity in the population, as well as economic and/or technological progress."
The Blessing of Sexuality: Evolution of Altruism with Mating Preference,Tanzhe Tang and Hang Ye,"Altruistic Punishment, Mating Preference, Sexual Attractiveness, Social Dilemma","Current simulation practices in artificial societies typically ignore the contribution of sexuality as a driving force for the evolution of prosocial behaviours. As recent researches in biology and genetics argued, sexual attractiveness, via the method of sexual selection, can explain many aspects of the second-order social dilemma. The basic hypothesis is that altruism is a sexually attractive virtue. To introduce the hypothesis into the analysis of human altruism, we employ the concepts of altruistic punishment and the behaviour-based sexual attractiveness to develop a gender-based evolutionary model where mating preference acts as the compensation to the male punishers from females in the given public goods game. In the model, the force of sexual selection is expressed as the effect of mating preference on altruism. The computer simulation indicates that social cohesion can be achieved by the existence of sexuality in an artificial society where the co-evolution of mating preference, altruistic punishment and cooperation exist. We then extend the model in two ways: (1) we employ the variable size population assumption to test the invasion capacity of cooperators, and (2) individual variation in altruistic investment is introduced to replace the average population payoff function in the baseline model. The variable size population and individual variation in investment are found to have amplifying effects on the evolution of altruism from different perspectives. Finally, we discuss the definition of altruism in dynamic evolutionary games, as well as the gender differences in the formation of altruism in primitive tribes."
