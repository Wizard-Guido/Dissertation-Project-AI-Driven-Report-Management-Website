# RAT Document Data Browser User Guide

## Introduction

RAT Document Data Browser empowers users to move their data to the Internet without the limit of devices that are used. It allows people to check data with any device at anytime as long as it is connected. It opens brand new avenues for managing rat document data in ABM (Agent Based Model) field.

RAT Document Data Browser, which we name RatDB for simplicity, is intended to be flexible and provide not only all the basic functionality to allow people to easily manage data online, but also some relevant document  recommendations for them based on the previous data they uploaded.

RatDD enable you to create and share your data on the platform. When you upload data, you can choose if it can be public. On the platform, you can also have a look at other's public rat documents.



**Notes:** As the website hasn't been deployed in the Internet, so the project can only run locally now and the following instructions are only for the purpose of testing and they require some CS knowledge background. However, if you don't want to be bothered, you can just watch the video of this website in action as well. 

## Preparations

In order to run the project locally, please make sure your PC has **npm, React library, and python Django installed**, and follow the steps below.

To initialize the RatDB project:

1. Upzip the project file.

2. Open front-end file in the terminal (If your OS is Windows, it will be Command Prompt). Type 'npm start' and run to activate the front-end.

3. Open back-end file in the terminal. Type 'python manage.py runserver' and run to activate the back-end.

   If you don't have any database software like MySQL, you can just use the embedded database of Django and reset the setting like that: 

   ```python
   DATABASES = {
       'default': {
           'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
           'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
       }
   }
   ```

6. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ url via your browser, and log in the Django administration with the username `arieskoo` and the password `gw010101`. After that, add at least one user information manually. And then you are able to test the website finally.
